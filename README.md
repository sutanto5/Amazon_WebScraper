**Description**

This project explores webscraping and sentiment analysis. It uses selenium to webscrape product reviews from the specified amazon product and saves them into a csv file for use in sentiment analysis

**Problem**
Amazon limits scraping to only 100 values and has systems in place to prevent workarounds, need to figure out how to get past that

**Current Work**
Currently working on sentiment analysis with the scraped csv files
