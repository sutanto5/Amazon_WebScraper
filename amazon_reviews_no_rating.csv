Sherrie A Bell,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025","This in some ways mirrors my own life story. I was in three homes and an orphanage. I know many of these stories and have lived the flight syndrome all my life.

Thank you sir for your vulnerability and willingness to deal with your life hurts.

Blessings and my prayers and support are with you Usha.

Your a great man JD Vance!"
Shawna White,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2025","I loved this book! I am pleased to have JD Vance as our VP. I am proud to be an American. The only thing I didn't like, was all of the cursing. I understand he was trying to paint a picture of who Mamaw was but I could have done without the F bombs and the GDs."
Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025","I could not put this book down. It is not political except to tell one man’s story of like as a Hillbilly in blue collar America. Vance’s story is honest , raw, and one of survival. It gives the reader a good understanding of what life in Appalachia is like. I highly recommend this book."
Grams,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2025","I am enjoying the read of this book. It opens the mind to a number of things, one is being thankful and feeling blessed for the little we had growing up and thankful for what we have these days. It shows the cultural stigma, which I also grew up in, in many varieties of neglect, abuse and stigma. An East and recommended read"
Carole Duff,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025","Honest, direct, and articulate, J.D. Vance writes about his coming-of-age in a low-income Appalachian extended family with lots of disruptions and few opportunities—all as a window into a cultural crisis. No government can fix the problems of this large segment of our society, but awareness might improve policies and soften our hearts to the struggles of humanity."
happycaregiver,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025","A very personal tale of a very interesting life of our new Vice President, but one that I think will resonate with many people across the country. We may not be “hillbillies “ but we had the same issues and we are all carrying the scars. We need to keep discussing these things and working together to find better ways of dealing with them then we did, our parents did and yes, our government has. A very important read as we move into the next 4 years and hopefully see some changes for the better."
Samantha,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025","Hillbilly Eligy deeply moved me. Having grown up in abject poverty in the middle of an otherwise middle-class neighborhood really left a lasting impact on me. His words regarding the struggle of straddling two worlds, his conflicting feelings regarding his relationship with his mother (mine was mental illness not drugs like his mother), and his struggle managing big feelings as a result of his childhood trauma really resonated with me. As someone who broke their family cycle and built a better world for their own children, like JD Vance did, I have mad respect for the man and his sister. Most will not fathom the courage it took to write that book and acknowledge it publicly in an effort to shed light on a oft misunderstood segment of society from a real world personal perspective. Well done sir."
Monte K. Maxwell,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025",I started this book to learn more about the futureVP of our country…I finished it with a deeper understanding of who JD is and why he stands for what he stands for. I also have seen societies similar to the hillbillies in my state of Arizona and wonder how I could become part of the solution instead of a bystanders
Mimi,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025",I’m so glad I read this book. I had seen the movie when it came out and liked it. The book goes much deeper into JD’s life and way of looking at life. He is truly a success story and achieved the American Dream through a lot of struggles and hard word. A true triumph over adversity. I learned so much about the Rust Belt and the Hillbillies. He’s an amazing person and will be a great VP.
Jiminylena,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025","I don’t know what I was expecting: the author has recently been elected to the Vice-presidency of the United States. I found this book to be profoundly honest and character-revealing. A survivor’s story, honestly presented. In a culture where an attractive and successful facade are preserved at all costs, this book shows a kind of raw honesty. I found it funny and tragic in equal measure, and applaud the author."
Sherry Boyd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025","People need to hear about the truth of white-collar workers; the struggles, the heartbreak of trying to just survive, and the failures of a lot of the American culture. People also need to learn about the survivors and the over comers."
Robert G. Walsh,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2025","I’m reading this after JD was elected Vice President, so my vantage point is much different than someone who read it before all the recent history has been made. I thoroughly enjoyed it and find it hopeful. If JD Vance can go from his broken and humble beginnings to become Vice President, anyone in our country can. Isn’t that the true story of the United States. God bless us."
deseretrat,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025","This book was a good look at what a large segment of our country has to deal with, and what one man did to overcome the conditions he grew up in. Maybe his experience can help find solutions too solve the problems he experienced. We know what is being done now isn't working."
HazelD,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025","Wow, what an interesting back story about JD Vance’s upbringing. He certainly overcame obstacles that many in the areas where he grew up. I won’t be a spoiler but this book is definitely worth the time to read."
Rachel Simon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025","I know five stars is the max, but this book deserves more! Hands down one of the best books I’ve ever read! I couldn’t put it down but then didn’t want it to end. Fantastic!!!"
Tom Rusk,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2025",J.D. is going to make a great vice president because of his background and military experience. My only complaint was the course language which I question really added to the story. Also I found the movie much different than the book.
Booklover,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025","Having taught over 50 years ago in hills country, coming from NYS, I found this intensely interesting. With a concentration in social sciences, it further enlightened me about the intricate part of family life in the area. However, I found my students to be endearingly naive to the outside world. Of course, the story was well-written with excellent character development and compelling from beginning to end. I would recommend teachers-in-training to be assigned the book to depict what many of their students could be experiencing in their home life to better relate to them."
Ryan Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025",This book really pulled up some emotions in me. What an incredible story. I bought it so that I could learn more about VP Vance since I didn't really know who he was. Reading this will allow you to understand him more and about what makes him operate. I could see parallels in his family and many American families I come across. Very good read and worth it regardless of what you think of his politics it is a must read.
Po-Yu,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2024","I knew about this book in 2016 when I was still a college student at Boston. I did not pay much attention to its release due to the beginning of Trump’s presidency; I guess I just assumed the memoir was some sort of a sociological testament to Trumpism, therefore I was not interested with having to read another story on mad white working-class people living in the Rust Belt.

Today, no longer a college kid, and at the same time being an elected councilor from Taiwan, I revisited this memoir because of Vance’s candidacy in 2024.

I must say, after finishing the book, I am very surprised with how much I actually enjoyed reading it.
The history of the district that I represent more or less reassemble with what Vance was describing from the Rust Belt, and how globalization has affected the societal structure of the area. I do see a lot of similarity to how working-class Taiwanese and American families are affected by these global changes.

However, I really like how Vance was honest about how his family got to the deepest point it did, and how he and his sister Lindsey got out of it, and even improved upon it despite facing such adversity socially and economically.

“God helps those who help themselves,” was what he quoted in the book, and I believe it speaks to everyone who reads it.

It does not really matter who is in charge of the government, if someone with disadvantages really want to get out from the situation they were being born into, it takes courage and resolve from the individual to fundamentally change those misfortunes from the family, or else they will just be doomed to become a repetition of excuses from old family lore."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025","Brutally honest about the destruction of white poor and middle class families by the infusion of the drug culture, poverty and poor education. I am so glad JD Vance made it out though the odds were against him, and think he will be a great Vice President, and work to improve all of America."
Kevin Mayfield,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2025",This book had me searching my soul about my own upbringing and working harder to understand those in my life whose childhoods bore some resmblance to JD's. Great read.
Cathy Megrath,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2025",This book was amazing! Every member of society should read this! It speaks volumes about the problems of society today & what WE can do to improve them! 1million percent recommend this!
Shawn Hamilton,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025","I'm glad that I read it. Although I define myself as a moderate, I have a lot in common with JD Vance and I appreciate his honestly in this book. He seems like someone I can trust."
evelyntennessee,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025","I have watched the movie four times, and finally bought the book. Several years ago when I saw the movie, I was brought to tears over what this young man went through, and I did not know who he was at all. Today, he was was inaugurated as the vice president of the United States. This great-grandmother is so very proud of him, and I know his family is extremely proud today. Congratulations JD. A must read book!"
Elephant Brands Distribution,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025","An intimate look at the childhood that formed the values and practical outlook of our Vice President. Refreshingly transparent, non judgmental and written with great compassion for the struggling families who live in communities that have been forgotten by most politicians. GREAT book!"
Joe Scheiner,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025",The story to me expands my appreciation for Mr. Vance. I see this a lot in my family and now understand more of the differences in peoples backgrounds that make up their lives and to not be stuck or to be stuck in what seems to be a pre-disposed way.
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025","I wanted to learn more about our new Vice President, so I purchased this highly acclaimed book. It is well-written and easy to read. I enjoy reading autobiographies. We all have a story to tell! I am glad JD Vance chose to give us a glimpse into his life and the events that shaped him into the man he is today."
Sam,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2024","I first stumbled upon Hillbilly Elegy when I was browsing netflix for something to watch. I saw the movie- but decided not to watch. Growing up in western north carolina, I figured I did not need to watch a film recounting the culture I have grown to call home. Fast forward a year and J.D. Vance is the future vice-president-elect; now, I had to read his book. Immediately, I found myself impressed with how well-written and structured Hillbilly Elegy is. JD paints a beautiful story revolving around his tumultuous upbringing, law-school, and even some family history dating back to 1920s. The emotional connection that JD has with his grandmother was translated extremely well through the book. I found myself understanding how instrumental JD’s grandmother was in his life. I was surprised at the quality of this book and wish the Vance family all the best in their future endeavors."
knash,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025",Read this book as part of a book club. Really enjoyed how honest and raw the look at JDs life was. I'm from North Carolina and parts of this book really resonated with me and my home town. Would absolutely read again and would recommend to others.
Constantinos E. Scaros,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025","I only read this book because JD Vance has a better-than-decent chance of becoming our next president. Otherwise, I didn't think I'd be particularly interested in learning about hillbillies. I was wrong.

Vance's writing is compelling and seems very genuine. He attributes his academic success not to money or connections, but to his mom's lifelong instillment of its virtues in him. That's how it was in my neighborhood too. Many of us attained advanced degrees and we too didn't come from money or connections. We were. a neighborhood of immigrants in NYC - very different from Appalachia, but ultimately not so different after all."
Susie Rosser,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025",Interesting read. I didn’t know anything about JD Vance before I picked up this book. I really agree with many of the things he said.
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025",Wonderful true story of coming from low income difficult home life to working hard and achieving great things. JD Vance is an amazing person.
stepha,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025","A good read, JD Vance reflects on issues in our society he has experienced first hand."
Kate,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025",Book is well written. Very interesting reading about different ways of living. Recommend this book.
Tbone,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","I bought this book after hearing about it during one of Vance's speeches. All I knew was it was a book he wrote and literally nothing more. Not knowing what it was about, it took several weeks to get around to it. But once I did, all I wanted to do was read more. I spoke about it to friends and family as it connected with me on a level few books do. No, I was not a hillbilly or from anywhere near Kentucky. But the characteristics of a messed up family life and how he reacted really hit home. The cultural similarities were absolutely shocking, considering I grew up totally middle class in CA. Keeping up the family image, not airing dirty laundry, ungodly fights, I simply did not expect any of the family life of a Kentucky hillbilly to resonate with a family from CA. Clinging to relatives for survival. The endless list of people who dramatically influenced his life for the positive. How he captured his feelings when he gets into an argument, even as an adult, unreal to me. Additionally, it was eye-opening to read his views on the situation from which he came - very poor, few figures to emulate, highly charged environment. And the issues these people face. You see things in a way that is much, much larger than simply, ""that family is poor. They must have made poor life choices."" The questions implied as to how can things be improved for these people, what role does or should government play, where is government intervention useless, what is the role of the society and culture in the development of the individuals. The book made me think about old issues in a very new light. I cannot wait to see the movie."
Cody Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021","Everybody has adversity to overcome in life. We are all dealt a different hand of cards and must do our best to beat the house. In Hillbilly Elegy, J.D. Vance tells of his own hardships growing up in rural Middletown Ohio, a city that has seen a steady decline in its social fabric (due in no small part to the evacuation of the steel industry). With a drug addicted mother and an absent father, he is still one of the lucky ones because he had a grandmother, or Mamaw, who watched out for him and encouraged him to do well in school. Sometimes all it takes is one adult figure to offer support and love to a child in order for them to ‘make it.’

In his book, Vance writes how he “watched some friends blossom into successful adults and others fall victim to the worst of Middletown’s temptations—premature parenthood, drugs, incarceration.” He continues: “What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are the expectations that they have for their own lives.” When I look back at my own childhood, this rings with an element of truth. In my family, for example, going to college was the expectation. There was never a conversation about whether or not I wanted to go, or whether or not it made sense for me to attend a university depending on what I wanted to do with my life as an adult. It was simply what kids like me did after high school. Only as an adult did I become aware of the other options to kids coming out of high school: working a job, traveling, joining the armed services or the peace corps, etc. But the expectation for me, set by my parents and by extension my middle class background, was that I go to college. While reading Hillbilly Elegy, I found myself wondering what it would feel like to not have that expectation, or any expectation of getting anything out of life at all. A truly existential crisis, and yet one that a huge population of the people in this country face!

Almost every aspect of Vance’s life was setting him up for failure. Whether it was the acceptance of gun violence as a means to settle arguments or his mother putting soda in his baby bottle, his life was designed to keep him incapable of growth in all the important ways. Yet somehow, he made it out and now lives a comfortable happy life in Cincinnati. While regulatory bodies have done their best to help, and some of their policies have indeed made it easier for poor people to afford food and medicine, the revelation that Vance offers inside these pages is that poverty is culturally systemic. The hardships of Hillbilly culture, abundant in Appalachia and the midwest, will be a losing battle for those of us on the outside wanting to help. Herein lies the million dollar question: how do we help a culture that views outsiders with suspicion and aggression? Not to mention a cultural pride that would never admit to having a problem in the first place, and would tell you to shove off if you asked.

The answer, it seems, is people like Vance. If he was able to grow up and ultimately thrive (he graduated from Yale Law School) then he is living proof that the American Dream is possible for the poor communities of the rust belt. Being an insider, perhaps he is the key, the antidote to a system inherently untrusting of outsiders. Sometimes all a child needs is a role model to aspire to, whether it be a politician, a musician, a scientist, or someone else of merit. Perhaps Vance can offer hope to some of the midwest’s most destitute children and communities.

This book ultimately helped me realize the vast differences in culture across the United States. While I was aware of worldwide cultural differences, I think it a truth that many of us forget the vast variety of people and different ways of life that exist within the 3 billion square miles of land that make up the continental United States. Hillbilly Elegy inspired empathy in me for people who grow up embroiled in trauma and I sincerely hope that Vance can find progressive ways to help uplift his broken community."
einsteinboricua,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2019","TL;DR version: recommended for understanding Appalachian Americans.

Long story: I grew up away from the states (Puerto Rico to be precise). My perception of the country has been that, with the exception of the Solid South (think Confederacy here), most of the states were on relative equal footing. Enter adulthood and my deeper understanding of the various regions in the country: the South, the Northeast, the Midwest, the Rust Belt, the ""Left"" Coast, the Mountainous West, the Plains, Appalachia...I still felt there was something more to all of them than just regional identities. There were two things I wanted to understand.

1. After the 2016 election when Trump was elected, I was baffled by some states and their overwhelming support of Trump. A state like Kansas was expected to go red. A state like Ohio usually never strays too far from the average, yet it went redder than normal. PA and MI were slightly tilted to the GOP. But the state that I found extremely surprising was West Virginia. The state had trending red at the federal level since the 2000 election when it gave Bush its electoral votes over Al Gore (the first time the state narrowly voted for the GOP, save for the waves of Reagan and Nixon) and it was clear that after Obama had won in 2008 and 2012, West Virginians had no more love for Democrats. Appalachia had been a reliable Democratic stronghold but little by little it eroded until in 2016 there were barely any pockets that supported Clinton. During the 2016 primaries, West Virginia Democrats overwhelmingly chose Bernie Sanders over Clinton. While Clinton may have doomed herself by saying she would kill coal, her proposal was not as radical as Sanders who also proposed an end to coal but had no plan for those affected by it. Kentucky was narrowly carried by Clinton, but the Appalachia region went for Sanders. How was it possible that these regions would support someone who would be more hawkish against coal than Clinton? And why do they cling to an industry that, contrary to what conservatives say, is dying because it's not economically feasible anymore?

2. As Southern states began trending Republican, it was understandable that the GOP adopted a policy of ""free market"" (i.e. reduce the role of government in many aspects) which many Southern conservatives still care about. West Virginia, however, bucked that trend until 2014, becoming the last state in the South to convert to the GOP. But I wonder if the change was more as a backlash against Democrats or because they truly believed in the GOP's policies. How was it possible that, while coal mines and factories shut down and folks become unemployed, the region continues to elect politicians that chip away at the social safety nets that can help these folks get back on their feet?

Enter a West Virginian coworker with whom I discussed these things. He said that to understand all of that, I needed to understand the culture of the area and he recommended this book. He had read for himself and he confirmed that, while his life wasn't as chaotic as the author's, he knew of many people who were like that and had seen his surroundings as matching those of the author. Granted, the author talks about Ohio and Kentucky (the two states where he lived most of his young life), but the region overall is Appalachia.

This book is definitely a must read. It brought a sense of understanding of the many struggles of the region and it made clear that the American system is not applied equally across the country. Even the poorest areas in the richer states are better off that many regions of Appalachia.

The author talks about the origins of his family (his maternal family as his biological dad is an absent figure) and the entire matriarchy down to his level. He talks about the psychological struggles of having a mother who verbally abuses him and even threatens to kill him, how his grandparents were his stabilizing figures, and how eventually he overcame all of it to become an accomplished lawyer and overall person. He also touches on personal responsibility. He admits to having made mistakes of his own and not blame them on anyone or anything (also noting how many in the region do not do it).

They say that before you judge a man, you must walk a mile in their shoes. Well, this book gives you that and so much more. For the record, though I identify as liberal in the political spectrum, I feel it is important to gain a better understanding of opposing views. Perhaps understanding the region overall can help us (and hopefully current and aspiring national politicians) identify the flaws in our system and ensure that the it works to the benefit of all and not just the successful ones.

In other words: if you're a liberal this is a very interesting read if you want to understand why some people think our ideas are stupid. And it highlights the importance of why some regions are the way they are."
Cheryl Racine,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025","Very readable...just shows that no matter where you come from if you are smart, motivated, and work hard you can be ANYTHING! This is America, after all!"
cheryl provence,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025",The best education on Hillbilly life you will ever receive. This book is beautifully written by someone who truly knows: J.D. Vance.
Ryan B,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2017","This book hit me like a ton of bricks. I was moved to tears more than once. There are parallels all over the place to the life of my parents, their parents, and to me. Also offered are insights into why there was shouting in my childhood home. Why there is (a decreasing amount of) shouting in my adulthood home. Why I am always ready for conflict. I've spent over 10 years now trying to understand myself better as I walk the path of constant improvement. I learned more in this book than in most of that time because the material is so relevant to my experience. Maybe I'm also ready to hear it. In some ways the story is a validation that nothing is wrong with me. JD's insights helped me understand why I am who I am. They also helped me understand that I'm still perpetuating some of the cycle. But I think we've broken it.

My father never met his biological father. He had 4 stepfathers though, and 10+ siblings with 4 different last names. I have an uncle Bubba. Yes, Bubba on the birth certificate. They traveled all over for various reasons and ended up in Baltimore. My father endured tremendous abuse but ""escaped"", in that he has a life long marriage and a job that (barely) got him to retirement without losing the progress he made. The Steel Mill in Baltimore shut down just 5 years ago. He has a modest home, a dog, poor health, little retirement, a successful son and a daughter who still lives at home, but has no real extended family connections. Still worlds beyond anyone else in his family.

My mother was a Mullins, and prior to her parents' marriage they were both already Mullins. They came from Appalachia. In fact my Great Uncle Denny wrote a series of books called Tales of Appalachia. For some reason my Granddaddy Mullins and his brothers seemed to largely make it out ok. Kind people with a gentle way and good families that pursued higher education. But my Mami Mullins was a different story. Mean, nasty to her kids, and a drunk. She was as sweet as pie to me but her impact on my mother ended up affecting me anyway. Granddaddy and Mami moved from Virginia to Baltimore for Mill Work like so many others. The Mullins descend from the Mayflower. American Originals.

Being 1 to 2 generations removed from Appalachia I can tell you the family culture follows. I lived in a home with lots of shouting and a fair amount of racism, sexism, poor decisions and abuse. But my parents stayed together. I have no idea how I made it out.

But like JD I don't fit into either world now. I'm not at home at the swim club, the golf course, with the dads sidelined at a birthday party, or the poker game where everyone flaunts their Alma matter gear as a badge of honor. Often the first questions asked include ""where did you go to school"", ""what is your handicap"", or perhaps casual conversation about vacations abroad. I have never left North America. Always a brutal reminder of your rung in society. It's not just money. As the years have passed and with the help of several mentors I have learned the manners and ways of the mid/upper class. Suffering judgement and horrible embarrassment along the way. My wife has taught me things that many children under 10 know (including mine now). Like waiting for others to get their food before eating, not eating the last of anything (ever), that iced tea shouldn't have 2 cups of sugar, or that your belt should match your shoes. God Bless her.

Conversely, I'm alienated by family that assumes I think I'm too good for them because of my slightly evolved behavior, habits, and parenting style. It's their insecurity but corrosive nonetheless. I'm shunned from events and cousins I spent years riding bikes and causing trouble with don't know how to talk to me. I can't associate with old friends with 1 or 2 exceptions.

But the guys in the new neighborhood can tell that I don't quite belong. So I'm partially accepted. I have succeeded in a white collar world with a tenacious drive and a God given brain. But I am not traditionally educated. I have a 20 year old son who was born when I was 17. He is a Junior at a private college. I have 4 younger children who will be educated and are being brought up with some of that hillbilly parenting style, though markedly less than generations before. And we try every day to continue breaking the cycle.

I think we did it. JD did it in one generation. It's taken us a series of steps."
Kathy of The Cove,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025","Interesting story and painting of an Americana culture. Well written, very down to earth."
Yvonne,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025","Beautifully written, very enjoyable to read
Don’t pass up this book on Vice President Vance"
Jason G,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024","When J.D. Vance got nominated to run for Vice President, I thought I would give this book a read. I had already seen the made of TV movie so I though I knew what to expect. Boy, was I wrong. The movie simply scratched the surface while the book went deep into the good, the bad and the ugly of growing up and living in general in the ""hillbilly"" culture. At times it is pretty humorous, at others, it is heartbreaking. And one very interesting thing for me was that it felt like no matter whether you could identify with the particular difficulties and nuances of the life Vance grew up knowing, there seemed to be something there we could all relate to in some way."
William K.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","I saw the movie before reading the book, and the movie makes a few changes. But the basic storyline remains the same. The author gives a description of his family and how his grandparents moved to Middletown, OH to find employment in the steel mill there. They made a mostly middle-class life there, but as time went on, family troubles reared their ugly head beginning before the author's birth. He found himself in an unstable family situation with an abusive mother and her revolving door of relationships, partners, boyfriends, and the occasional ex-husband. His grandmother took an interest and he was able to turn his life around and discover a way out of that place and life. He states that just living his life has taught him things that the average person in Middletown would have no way of knowing. He was able to achieve an amazing amount of upward mobility by making some smart choices and being willing to set goals and work for them.

His concern is that he sees the people from his hometown and many others like them slipping into an abyss of poverty, addiction, and abuse. Some of this is self-inflicted, and that the people seem to have lost their drive, ambition, and upward mobility. He fears that we stand to lose a large segment of society because of these problems, and states that society cannot afford to let its working-class people sink into quicksand. It goes contrary to the American Dream, but he said it's telling that several European countries are doing the American Dream better than we do here because their working classes have experienced far more upward mobility than ours has.

He does not claim to have a sweeping solution nor all the answers to every question or concern. But he is right to be concerned. Call the book the canary in the coal mine who might be chirping just before it's too late. Also, it's a terrible shame that this book will be given some kind of knee-jerk discrediting because the author espouses politically conservative viewpoints. This is not a conservative book. This is a memoir that takes a hard look at society and is concerned by what is revealed."
Jesse Brown,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","No wonder “Hillbilly Elegy” by J.D. Vance is #1 on Amazon’s top purchased books in July 2024, a New York Times Best Seller, and a Netflix movie!!!!!!

(This review does not contain vital spoilers.)

J.D. should be commended for his poignant work, not solely for its exceptional literary quality but for the emotional and informative depth that resonates throughout the narrative. His ability to evoke genuine sentiment is a testament to his storytelling prowess, shocking experiences, and time as a life-long learner. While reading, I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading non-fiction.

His mother was constantly changing up what the “D” in “J.D.” stood for. For me, a humorous moment in the book is when J.D. remarks on his aversion to the name ""Donald."" When writing this, he had no way of knowing who his future running mate for the United States Presidential Candidacy would be 8 years after this masterpiece was published. That made me laugh out loud.

J.D.'s candid portrayal of his family's struggles offers a stark portrayal of small-town America, urging readers to look beyond initial impressions. I can’t put into words the courage it must have taken him to share the darkest moments and terrible choices of his mother (and other family members) for the world to read about. His courage in revealing personal hardships and familial dynamics underscores the book's authenticity and societal relevance.

J.D.'s exploration of the cyclical nature of poverty, addiction, and fractured families underscores a broader message of resilience and the capacity for change. By drawing parallels between different communities facing systemic challenges, he prompts reflection on shared human experiences and the potential for societal transformation. J.D. proves that we are not facing a race war, but a socioeconomic one right here within our own borders.

J.D. wrote: “Mamaw and Papaw taught me that we live in the best and greatest country on earth. This fact gave meaning to my childhood. Whenever times were tough- when I felt overwhelmed by the drama and the tumult of my youth- I knew that better days were ahead because I lived in a country that allowed me to make the good choices that others hadn’t. (Chapter 11)” That is the sum of this book.

I wholeheartedly recommend “Hillbilly Elegy” to EVERYONE regardless of political affiliations. It serves as a poignant commentary on humanity, the pursuit of the American Dream, and the resilience inherent in the face of adversity. J.D.'s narrative has the power to inspire and provoke thought, leaving a lasting impact on readers. This is an elegy that will stick with me for so many good reasons.

J.D., if you happen to read this review- Thank you for your service in the Marine Corps. Thank you for sharing this highly personal story. Thank you for standing for what is right. And thank you for agreeing to be our next Vice President. Congratulations to your mom on 10 years of sobriety. I’m praying for your family, you, and our country."

Thomas M. Loarie,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2016","Author J.D. Vance in his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” provides a first-hand account of growing up and then escaping a small town in Appalachia where the manufacturing jobs have been disappearing, wages have been stagnant, and opiate addiction has become rampant. The book speaks to the anger and frustration of the “forgotten” white working class not only in Appalachia but to other areas of the country which have suffered the same fate. These are the people who were without a voice and found one in Donald Trump. These are the people who changed the trajectory of American politics in 2016.

But most importantly, this book speaks to love, to the importance of family and to adult mentors who are committed to human potential. Vance’s escape from generational hopelessness had nothing to do with public programs and social services, most of which made things worse.

(Vance’s experience echoes the work of Mitch Pearlstein’s excellent book, “From Family Collapse to America’s Decline,” which goes beyond rural America and encompasses the plight of all low and middle income Americans who are being squeezed by job loss and stagnant wages.)

Vance did not grow up with parents who modeled love, how to seek the truth, how to be considerate and forgiving, how to work together, and how to grow in virtue. His family environment was unstable and did not provide an opportunity for him to become what God was calling him to be.

His early family life in Kentucky then in southeastern Ohio was tough. His mother got pregnant at 18, was divorced by 19 and remarried four times. She became a heroin addict after becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. At one time, she threatened to kill them both by crashing her car. His biological father was an absentee dad.

His escape had everything to do with the love of his grandparents, their faith in God and their commitment to a better future for Vance. He moved in with them in high school. They were the ones who inspired Vance to do more with his life. By always being there for him, they provided love and some semblance of stability by always being there for him.

The Marines then filled in by teaching personal discipline and how he could negotiate the simple things of adult life… like how to get a low interest loan. Later teachers at Yale pushed Vance to educational excellence.

Vance wrote the book to answer questions about his own upbringing and how he arrived at an Ivy League school and today, at an investment firm in San Francisco. The book’s publication in 2016 was timely as it intersected with Donald Trump’s presidential run and his “Make America Great” campaign which zeroed in on the plight of the white working-class. Vance’s experience has since become a part of the national conversation about social divisions in the United States and feelings of disenfranchisement among the white working class.

According to Vance, the secret sauce for those disenfranchised is not found in public initiatives. No amount of government handouts and safety nets will ever match what love can do - Love within an intact family, love of teaching others to reach their potential and, most importantly, the love of God as shown to us by others and their good works.

Vance believes the following needs to be done to help others escape “hopelessness”:
o Religious leaders need to build communities that engage people to help one another.
o Parents need to recognize how destructive chaos – fighting, screaming, addiction, divorce - is to their children’s future.
o School leaders need to be more cognizant of what’s going on in student’s home life. A student living in chaos will focuse on survival not grades.
o Most of all, people must hold themselves (and be held) responsible for their own conduct and choices. “Those of us who were not given every advantage can make better choices and those choices do have the power to affect our lives.”

The greatest contributor to the common good is the family, in which children are brought into the world by the faithful and lasting love of a man and woman. It is the first and indispensable school of love, and when a majority of its citizens are deprived of it, society itself becomes chaotic and angry. In a loving and stable home, built on faith and virtue, parents model for their children out of love, how to seek the truth, how to be considerate and forgiving, how to work together, how to grow in virtue and the right use of freedom and how to be generous to those in need. In such homes, young people have the greatest opportunity to become those men and women God is calling them to be.

Indeed, the family is the glue that holds our culture and our society together. Vance was fortunate that he had the “family” provided by his grandparents. They were the glue."

Dave Schwinghammer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","The protagonist of HILLBILLY ELEGY does not sound like the V.P. candidate who refers to liberal females as “cat ladies”. Young J.D. Vance sounds like an admirable person who pulled himself up by his bootstraps.

J.D.’s mother was an addict. At first it sounded like she was hooked on opioid pills but later on there was a reference to heroin. Anyway, J.D. spent the last three years of high school living with Mamaw, his grandmother.

J.D. has a lot to say about the hillbillies who moved from Jackson, Kentucky to Middletown, Ohio. They brought their culture with them. For instance one transplanted hillbilly got in trouble with the town government over keeping chickens in his back yard. J.D. goes on to say “...hillbillies shared many regional characteristics with the southern blacks arriving in Detroit.” J.D. had to deal with abuse, alcoholism, and poverty. The sound of family life he was familiar with was a lot of yelling and screaming.

J.D. didn’t hear that at his Mamaw’s house. She encouraged him to succeed, and he did, joining the marines. He says the marines taught him how to be a man; at one point he was about to pay 22% interest on a loan to buy a car, but his fellow marines talked him out of that, and he got the loan for half that. From there he went to Ohio State on the G.I. bill, graduating in two years, after which he was accepted at Yale Law School, but he still felt like a hillbilly amongst his mostly rich classmates.

Considering where he came from and the mountains he had to climb, it’s hard to believe this guy is running for V.P. alongside Donald J. Trump, his direct opposite."

Though I may not have reached the pinnacle of JD Vance; I am satisfied as to how far I have come in my life but the book also makes me realize I could have done more if I had the capacity to understand how much family drama would have played in my decision making. Thank You JD.

Bridgette Holley,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","My interest in the now Vice President-Elect, J.D. Vance was piqued by comments he made at the 2024 Republican National Convention regarding his Mamaw and her 19 guns.

I instantly connected with his description of her. For the record, my grandma’s self-defense weapon of choice was the machete.

I sought to find out, how much in common does a black woman raised in rural Eastern North Carolina have in common with a hillbilly with roots in Appalachia?

It turns out, a lot. For starters, we are both 40 and our grandmothers played pivotal roles in our lives. In the book, when he spoke of the expectation of having “a good Christmas” as a child, and his culture shocks in the Marine Corps and college, his experiences mirrored my own.

A few of many quotes that resonated with me:

“I’ve seen far too many people awash in genuine desire to change only to lose their mettle when they realize just how difficult change actually is.”

“I learned that the very traits that enabled my survival during childhood inhibit my success as an adult.”

“Social capital is all around us. Those who tap into it and use it prosper.”

For many, whose adult life is so drastically different from their childhood, reading Hillbilly Elegy is like going home…and saying goodbye."

Most Americans have no concept of this culture and their way of living. He shares his trials and triumphs, and his ideas of how to help these children. What he went through and what he achieved is amazing. It is truly a remarkable book about an incredible life. I highly recommend this book."

Wendy Oconnell,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2018","I read The Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance because it is on my daughter’s reading list this summer and reading what she reads allows me to connect with her through our life long love of books. The Hillbilly Elegy is the best book I’ve read in a long time. The last book I read on my daughter’s list was Ayn Rand’s Anthem, and the classical rhetorical laced with her “I” agenda made me graze pages like a fat cow eager for slaughter. Kill me, please! No offense to Rand, she has her merits, but I wanted a story. I am a big tootsie pop (sucker) for good stories. Now several key ingredients make up a well-constructed story beginning with a Shakespearean understanding of the human condition.
1. Vance understands the human condition. The human condition are the characteristics, essential events, and particular events which evolve around birth, growth, and inner and outer conflict.
“Mamaw could spew venom like a Marine Corps drill instructor, but what she saw in our community didn’t just piss her off. It broke her heart.”
Vance understands what motivates the anger behind his Mamaw’s words, and it cuts at the core of the human condition. Vance’s book is loaded with this understanding, not just Mamaw, but his father and the reason he gave him up in the first place, his mother and her continuous struggle with drugs and men, his Aunt Wee, and his sister Lindsay, and finally his own human condition revealed in the monster dream at the end.
2. Themes of forgiveness bathed in hope and the strength to overcome adversity. Vance came from dirt poor and turned Ivy League Yale graduate now living the American dream. He didn’t make that journey with the human feelings of anger and resentment that often blames others for their circumstances; He made it with love, forgiveness and understanding.
“For me understanding my past and knowing I wasn’t doomed gave me the hope and fortitude to deal with the demons of my youth.”

3. Humility: Vance credits his success hugely to his mamaw and papaw. “Few of even my closest friends understood how utterly hopeless my life would have been without Mamaw and Papaw. So maybe I just wanted to give credit where credit is due.”

He doesn’t only credit Mamaw and Papaw, but a whole slew of blue-collar workers who helped him to achieve his Ivy League dream. These people include his sister, his cousin Gail, his Aunt Wee and even his mother, despite her many problems, instilled in him a lifelong love of education.
Vance says, “Remove any of these people from the equation and I’m probably screwed.”

4. Accessibility: The Hemingway/Shrunk in White style of writing has a conversational syntax that can be grasped by anyone. Vance may be Ivy League now, but he still has the heart of his hillbilly ancestors and he knows how to speak to them and for them.

5. Humor: This book will make you laugh out loud despite some of the horrific circumstances in Vance’s childhood, the laughter was the hope as conveyed in many of Mamaw’s speeches, especially this particular one on bullying.

“And she said something I will never forget: ‘Sometimes, honey, you have to fight, even when you’re not defending yourself. Sometimes it’s just the right thing to do.’ Then she taught me a move, a swift hard (make sure to turn your hips) punch right to the gut.”

6. Solutions: Glass Castle by Jeanette Walls is similar to Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy because it shows a tough upbringing turned successful; however, as good as that story was, Walls did not offer any solutions for the homeless. Now, I’m not saying Vance offers great solutions for the problems with poverty in our country, but he does offer simple solutions, ones involving self-examination and our role in society. Recently, someone told me to read Black Rednecks and White Liberals by Thomas Sowell (the title made me hesitate reminding me of a book Tom Buchanan liked in The Great Gatsby), now while this book probably offers great solutions; It was not what I looked for with Vance’s book. In Vance’s book I looked for a story about a poor boy who went Ivy. Vance’s book is a memoir and the parallel to Sowell’s non-fiction book just doesn’t work here. I recommend Vance’s book to all of those people who still believe in the American Dream and the hope and love where good family support fuels the dream. Vance’s tone is so optimistic for those wanting to follow a similar path, and even more so to everyone who wants stability, a home, a family and love."
