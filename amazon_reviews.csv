PRNLM,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2016","There is a lot to take in here, even for someone that's seen this life up close in many of its many guises.

While ostensibly about the particular culture of the West Virginia Scots-Irish underclass, anyone that has seen white poverty in America's flyover states will recognize much of what is written about here. It is a life on the very edge of plausibility, without the sense of extra-family community that serves as a stabilizing agent in many first-generation immigrant communities or communities of color. Drugs, crime, jail time, abusive interactions without any knowledge of other forms of interaction, children growing up in a wild mix of stoned mother care, foster care, and care by temporary ""boyfriends,"" and in general, an image of life on the edge of survival where even the heroes are distinctly flawed for lack of knowledge and experience of any other way of living.

This is a story that many of the ""upwardly mobile middle class"" in the coastal areas, often so quick to judge the lifestyles and politics of ""those people"" in middle America, has no clue about. I speak from experience as someone that grew up in the heartland but has spent years in often elite circles on either coast.

Two things struck me most about this book.

First, the unflinching yet not judgmental portrayal of the circumstances and of the people involved. It is difficult to write on this subject without either glossing over the ugliness and making warm and fuzzy appeals to idealism and human nature, Hollywood style, or without on the other hand descending into attempts at political persuasion and calls to activism. This book manages to paint the picture, in deeply moving ways, without committing either sin, to my eye.

Second, the author's growing realization, fully present by the end of the work, that while individuals do not have total control over the shapes of their lives, their choices do in fact matter—that even if one can't direct one's life like a film, one does always have the at least the input into life that comes from being free to make choices, every day, and in every situation.

It is this latter point, combined with the general readability and writing skill in evidence here, that earns five stars from me. Despite appearances, I found this to be an inspiring book. I came away feeling empowered and edified, and almost wishing I'd become a Marine in my younger days as the author decided to do—something I've never thought or felt before.

I hate to fall into self-analysis and virtue-signaling behavior in a public review, but in this case I feel compelled to say that the author really did leave with me a renewed motivation to make more of my life every day, to respect and consider the choices that confront me much more carefully, and to seize moments of opportunity with aplomb when they present themselves. Given that a Hillbilly like the author can find his way and make good choices despite the obstacles he's encountered, many readers will find themselves stripped bare and exposed—undeniably ungrateful and just a bit self-absorbed for not making more of the hand we've been dealt every day.

I'm a big fan of edifying reads, and though given the subject matter one might imagine this book to be anything but, in fact this book left me significantly better than it found me in many ways. It also did much to renew my awareness of the differences that define us in this country, and of the many distinct kinds of suffering and heroism that exist.

Well worth your time."
J. Foster,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2017","J.D. Vance chronicles his ""upwardly mobile"" journey from a dirt-poor boy in the backwoods of Kentucky, to a Yale-educated lawyer in Washington D.C. It is quite a journey, to be sure. J.D.'s story is one of family ties, bad choices, cyclical dysfunction, and in some cases, redemption.

""Hillbilly Elegy"" first landed on my reading list due to an article in my newsfeed that listed Vance's memoir as potential insight into the group that supposedly swung this year's election in favor of Donald Trump - poor, working-class whites in the country's rust belt. We do indeed get an insider's glimpse into the mindset and lifestyle of the poor, white communities in Appalachia and surrounding regions. Yet politics and analysis is minimal, so any link between the group in question and our president is left mostly as an exercise for the reader.

The book is fascinating on many levels, the least of which was the dichotomy between the strong family ties upon which the hillbillies draw their strength and honor, and the dysfunction, cheating, brawling, and deep-seated anger present in their everyday lives. Blood is indeed, thicker than water.

To me, the real question is just how we break the cycle of poverty and bad choices. One particular story Vance relays typifies the scenario played out over and over in his community. A young man with a pregnant girlfriend landed a decent job in a tile warehouse. This man was chronically late, missed work at least once a week, and took hour-long bathroom breaks. Though warned repeatedly, his behavior did not change. Yet when he was finally fired, he lashed out at the manager for being inconsiderate of his difficult home situation (which, of course, he created in the first place!).

This mindset of blaming others is very prevalent throughout the book. The author, however, places some of the blame at the foot of the conservative rhetoric - instead of pushing the poor to engage their issues, ""the message of the right is increasingly: It’s not your fault that you’re a loser; it’s the government’s fault."" I think this is a bit of a cop out, and to be honest, struck me as pandering to liberal elite that runs most of the media in this country. I would suggest that the creation of our massive welfare state, and the dependence of the poor on government handouts with little to no accountability is much more responsible for the poor's inability to truly confront their station in life.

Similarly, Vance takes some time to disparage evangelical theology as taught by the church his dad attended. To be sure, there is often much to disparage. In fact, the suspicion of science and government held by his dad's church mirrors the attitude of many of my fellow evangelical brothers and sisters. Yet, the irony that his dad's home life was one of the few peaceful and stable families in his entire existence is not lost on Vance. In fact, he admits, ""Dad embodied a phenomenon social scientists have observed for decades: Religious folks are much happier. Regular church attendees commit fewer crimes, are in better health, live longer, make more money, drop out of high school less frequently, and finish college more frequently than those who don’t attend church at all.""

Sometimes I think society at large wants the results of what they find in the church and organized religion, yet chafe at the thought of being told what to do, and what behavior is acceptable and what is not. The fact that possibly you can't get one without the other is a possibility our ""enlightened"" minds simply do not want to consider. And what is it, exactly, that these church-going people find at church? It's not a ""phenomenon,"" as Vance categorizes it, but the power of Jesus Christ.

I feel I would be remiss, as well, at this point not to push back against a sentiment Vance conveys as popular truth - evangelical churches are shedding members at an alarming rate. As a proof-point, he references an article from the Huffington Post that makes the tired claim that evangelicalism is being rejected by the current generation. Huffington Post, the darling child of hipsters and liberals everywhere, has never been a friend of evangelicals, and I would hope other, more balanced studies would be considered. The book, ""Christians are Hate-Filled Hypocrites...And Other Lies You've Been Told"" is a good place to start. Using strong scientific and statistical analysis, it directly refutes some of the very studies mentioned in the HP article. Anyway, I digress. Admittedly, conservative politics and the supposed failure of evangelicalism are overall a smaller focus in the book.

For the most part, Vance simply recounts the story of his life, and that of his closest relatives. It is fascinating, heart-breaking, and often akin to watching the proverbial train wreck. In fact, I wonder if that is one reason the book has been so popular. For most of us, we can read about the dysfunction so prevalent in Vance's upbringing and pat ourselves on the back - we're not perfect, but at least we're not as bad as that Vance clan!

Only near the end of the book, in Chapter 14, does Vance attempt some deeper analysis and retrospective thinking. And I would hope we would do the same. The situation surrounding poor, working-class whites in the Midwest, similar to that surrounding African Americans in urban settings, is complex and difficult, with no easy answers. But that doesn't mean we should't still be tackling these inconvenient issues. Everything from how we respond to the poor, to how we treat our spouse, is on the table.

I appreciate Vance airing out his dirty laundry. I doubt many of us would want our family's deepest and darkest secrets to be exposed in a book for all to read. But in doing so, he gives us the opportunity to participate in the plight of an entire segment of our population that, until the last year, was rarely spoken of.

---------------
I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between both sites.

5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only 25 in a lifetime.
4 - Very good.
3 - Worth your time.
2 - Not very good.
1 - Atrocious"
Ted Lehmann,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2017","Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J.D. Vance (Harper Collins, 2016, $12.59/15.99) has been on the NY Times Best Seller List for forty-nine weeks, and at the time of this writing, stands at number two. This touching, revealing, warm, sad, and inspiring memoir, written by a Yale Law School graduate whose childhood was spent in the hills of eastern Kentucky and the migrated community of Middletown, OH, opens many sores while explaining in the most human and personal terms possible the pain and misunderstanding that harms working class and poor white Americans in the Hheartlands. Throughout this tale Vance sometimes mentions findings of academic studies and other research, using them to support or introduce his own poignant experiences, but, most of all, this is the story of one man's ability to persevere in an environment where success such as he has experienced is rare, and , according to him psychically costly as well as economically expensive.

Living within a home with serial father figures coming and going and an alcoholic, drug addicted mother, he attributes the source of his core values to life in rural Jackson, Kentucky in the hills and hollers of Appalachia with his Mamaw and any number of uncles and cousins. He describes on academic paper in which the authors suggest that “hillbillies learn from an early age to deal with uncomfortable truths by avoiding them, or by pretending better truths exist, a characteristic of bluegrass music, too. Vance refuses to look the others way.

Vance tracks the two major migrations from Appalachia to the industrial mid-west, particularly Middletown, OH, which were mirrored in the South, mid-South and New England, the depression era migrations and the post-WWII migration of returning veterans. He examines how the regions prospered and then died off with the decline of America industrial might, leaving abandoned neighborhoods, unemployment, and drug dependency behind, attributing this to both bad government policies and globalism.

Vance consistently refers to himself and his family as being poor and then at other times being “working class.” Joan C. Williams, in White Working Class seems to make a clear distinction between the two while Vance vacillates. He talks about “his people,” Kentucky migrants to southern Ohio, as often living off the dole, not working, and being plagued by drugs and violence, yet also talks about an uncle who escapes to the middle class, and his mother who, despite being an addict, was a nurse who was able to work a good deal of the time. He glories, however, in his extended family, his many uncles who provide him with male role models in both positive and negative ways. At times he seems remarkably judgmental, while at others, forgiving.

As Vance matures through adolescence, he begins to see the disjointures between both liberal and conservative points of view. He sees many of the government programs as well meaning but ineffective while the conservative solutions were disciplinary and draconian. In his reading of sociology, while in high school, he began to realize that the situation of black people described in his readings about black America contained the same dilemmas as did the lives and existence of the white working poor from Appalachia. “Our Elegy is a sociological one, yes, but it is also about psychology and community and culture and faith.” (144) He's writing about religion, work, and family when he observes the deep “cognitive dissonance between the world we see and the values we preach.” (147)

As Vance prepares to attend Yale Law School he explains in touching, no-holds-barred language why a person like him, growing up in poverty, bedeviled by the rigors of having a drug addicted mother living with multiple husbands, and seemingly inured to violence and loss could reject the attractions of both the left and the right. These chapters, presented within the context of an actual life lived in poverty and difficulty, if not despair, bring so many working class and poor white men, especially, to accept so much patently untrue or misleading material in seeking to understand who they are, why they got that way, and how difficult it is to extricate oneself. In short, Vance asserts, it's easier for many to blame “the other” than it is to do the hard analysis of one's own choices, accept the verdict, and get to work to change things. What sets J.D. Vance apart is his ongoing optimism, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Interestingly, Hillbilly Elegy can also stand as a “How To” book for those seeking to find their own way to a different place in both the workplace and in society. For instance, the non-verbal behavioral cues of social class are significantly different than the behaviors that pass for progressing in working class employment and social environments. Vance shows himself always to be exceptionally alert to what's going on around him. As he gains in self confidence, his ability to ask questions of those he trusts increases. He's also a very fast learner. Nevertheless he owns to deep feelings of abandoning the culture from which he comes while yearning to become part of that with which he's not, yet, thoroughly familiar. However, the struggle is neither easy nor always successful.

Throughout Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, Vance scatters data and information from relevant sociological and psychological writing to illuminate the points he makes, to give them a solid theoretical context. Such use of accurate research information never seems intrusive or fault-finding. Rather, it seeks to help a reader generalize from the highly personal revelation of the pain and confusion of Vance's childhood. It helps the reader gain understanding and perspective without ever excusing either those who raised him or his own mis-understandings, missed paths, and possibly botched relationships. He bravely opens the scars on his psyche, examines them, faces their consequences, and comes out the other side a stronger and better person. His painstaking honesty with the reader and his courage are never in doubt. This is not a book for the reader to quarrel with. Rather, it requires being good listeners, seeking to find the truths as they apply to them. Some would prescribe better, more effective programs. Others view the problems of poverty and drug addiction as the fault of the victim. While, ultimately, Vance looks towards personal responsibility for life, he fully understands the necessity for a compassionate government and individual acceptance of responsibility working together to make progress possible for all. I bought the book and read it on my Kindle app."
Fnu Lnu,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2016","This is an exceptional memoir, particularly from an author so young. JD Vance's account of growing up among the Appalachian transplants in Ohio is loving and respectful as much as it is critical of the self-defeating lives he's seen so many lead. Vance writes from a conservative viewpoint, but his tale is filled with compassion and a sophisticated understanding of people and institutions.

Vance’s grit, his personal honesty and the way he gives credit to others - his grandparents, his sister, the US Marines - made me like and admire him from the beginning. On the other hand, I think he too often downplays the fact that social forces, not just lack of individual and family will, have crushed the spirit of many Appalachian people. While Vance was able, with lots of help, to pull himself up and out, I don't think his story is representative of those of many poor Appalachian families. For instance, his grandma, ""Mamaw,"" has enough resources to put Vance's mother through extensive in-patient drug rehab. Is that possible for most drug-addled Appalachian and Rustbelt families? Have you priced in-patient rehab lately?

Vance is at his best when he's describing his initiation to the rare air of Yale Law and the recruiting marathon for postgrad jobs with top firms. While his take on life as a tourist in the upper crust is hilarious, his acceptance of that lifestyle as a key to a better life is a little cynical. He's essentially saying, ""It's superficial and snobbish, but kids, you've gotta roll with it to make something of yourself!""

These are chippy criticisms of a fine piece of writing from an engaging young author. JD Vance has a lot to say. Hillbilly Elegy is particularly relevant on the crest of the Trump Revolution, supported by many of the folks Vance so lovingly and critically describes. I'm recommending this book to all my friends.

Richard B. Schwartz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2017","It may be that the most interesting thing about this book is its resonance. A coming-of-age blue collar memoir, it sits (nearly) atop the bestseller list and has drawn over 7,000 Amazon reviews. While it appears to focus on a singular phenomenon its impact has been generalized by the author and now touches tens of thousands of readers.

The phenomenon is the migration of job-seeking Scots-Irish Appalachians to southwestern Ohio. I know this process intimately. My own parents were from Kentucky and settled in Cincinnati. We lived in what may be the epicenter of such migrations, a town called Norwood that is surrounded by Cincinnati. I described my experiences there in a memoir entitled THE BIGGEST CITY IN AMERICA (1999). Norwood was once home to a plethora of manufacturers, a few of which remain. U.S. Playing Card, Allis-Chalmers, American Laundry, the Fisher Body Plant (making Camaros), et al. drew workers from Appalachia who often held jobs there during the week and returned to Kentucky on the weekends. They huddled together in single homes; in Cincinnati poker parlance, a full house is a ‘full Norwood’. Now, Norwood has lost one third of its population; two of its three Catholic churches have closed and its manufacturing base has largely disappeared. What happens to people under such circumstances? Some survive, Charles Murray suggests, by maintaining social capital and making sound choices. They complete school, hold off on procreating until they are married, take a role in their community’s civic life and practice their religion.

J.D. Vance lives betwixt and between. He knows the experience of the dysfunctional and he exemplifies the possibilities of escape and success. Throughout his book, but particularly in its second half, he reflects on the manner in which some choose drugs, promiscuity and dependency, while others sustain the foundational elements of life which protect them and their families. Another way to think about this (along with the decline of manufacturing and the reduction of blue-collar opportunities) is that the 1960’s offered freedom, but part of that freedom (drugs, free love) turned out to be cataclysmic for those who allowed themselves to be set adrift. The decline of job opportunities exacerbated that situation. So too, perhaps, did the expansion of the opportunities for government dependency. Working as a clerk bagging groceries, e.g., Vance reflects on those who work the food stamp system while others invest the labor that pays for it.

This particular migration story is a powerful one. My Mizzou Chancellor, Brady Deaton, wrote his Wisconsin doctoral dissertation on it and our distinguished graduate, James Lee Burke, wrote a wonderful novel on the subject (TO THE BRIGHT AND SHINING SUN). Vance’s take on it succeeds for a number of reasons. First, the book is beautifully written and personally compelling. He offers us a privileged look into the strengths and dysfunctionalities of his own family. While the migration issue is susceptible to significant economic analysis, Vance puts living flesh on the bones of theory. He brings the story home to the reader as he explores the human hearts and souls which populate his narrative. We see real people, speaking real words and bleeding real blood. (I wish that he had included illustrations, but if you check out his Megyn Kelly interview clips you will see his beloved grandmother and sister and even catch a glimpse of his troubled mother.)

He is honest with regard to his own experience. Four years in the Marine Corps help to stabilize his life and enable him to utilize his GI Bill benefits to attend Ohio State. An old Army friend of mine once said that his most gratifying work as a company commander was helping people who had never really belonged to anything actually do so. When he moves on from Ohio State to Yale law school he reveals his cultural naivete; he never really realized, e.g., that belts and shoes are supposed to match and when he was offered Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay at a recruitment dinner he chose the one that was easiest to pronounce.

The book succeeds in part because it is a wonderful redemption story, but it is more complex than that. James Ellroy asked Dick Contino if he could write a novella about his life. What’s it about? Contino asked. “Heavily-compromised redemption,” Ellroy responded and Contino agreed. J.D. Vance’s redemption is not heavily-compromised, but it reveals the knife edge that he walked and the dangers that remain on the dark side, a side still inhabited by those he knows and loves. This may be the surprise hit of the year; the Harper editors who agreed to publish it were very shrewd to do so. The story gives heart to all and helps many find a voice that speaks for them."
Tom and Kristen Wannemacher,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025","The title is in reference to the book, but it could also be said about JD Vance as well. I've been wanting to read this, even moreso since the election, and I'm so glad I did. A fellow Ohioan, Conservative and a 1984 baby as well.... I cant help but relate, on the surface level. But reading this book I feel even more connected-and seen! So many times I found myself highlighting sentences, paragraphs that spoke right to my soul, and put into words how I am feeling.
The book is a wonderful mix of family drama which hives insights into how not only he grew up, but many others have as well. Of course theres the adversity and overcoming so many obstacles that really makes you want to root for him, but also the poitics and such where, after reading this, I have SO much hope for the future. I really admire JD Vance more now after reading the book and seeing where he came from..... knowing where he has made it to."
Robert A Haworth,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2017","This is an engaging and insightful book about what it is like to inherit and experience the Scots-Irish culture of Appalachia, even though Vance grew up in Middletown Ohio, the grandson of grandparents who migrated to Ohio in the late 1940s from Kentucky in search of a better life. The grandparents (Mamaw & Papaw) found that better life economically, but struggled with dysfunction in their family lives. The dysfunction carried over from their culture of origin, in combination with some poor choices (Papaw became an alcoholic and a womanizer), such that family dysfunction was perpetuated to the children. JD’s mom was pregnant out of high school, then a single mom with multiple boyfriends and husbands as JD was growing up, and became addicted to pain killers. Much of the story of the book is about how JD navigated these difficult circumstances, but the takeaway is really about what it took for him to escape the usually miserable consequences of that kind of existence, ultimately graduating from Yale law school into a lucrative career.
First, the good.
a) The anecdotal features of this memoir makes the book hard to put down.
b) JD is clearly driven by the desire to understand the sociological and other issues that lie at the root of the dysfunction of his own and many other families of a similar cultural heritage. He has clearly done some study on this, and quotes from a sprinkling of academic studies to bolster his first hand observations. This is not, however, a handbook on policy, and JD is not afraid to confess his limitations.
c) In spite of the shortcomings of Mamaw and Papaw, they are clearly the heroes of the book, stepping in to raise JD in the absence of motherly responsibility. JD says they were the best thing that happened to him. They showed him the value of love and stability, believed in the value of hard work, and did their best to ensure that he had his shot at the American dream.
d) JD is brutally honest in his evaluation of his family and his cultural heritage, and does not pull any punches. In spite of this, it is clear that he loves his family and their heritage. Indeed, this drives his desire to understand why they are the way they are, as a precursor to finding solutions to those characteristics that are so socially devastating.
e) A clear message that emerges from this book is the dominant impact on children of what is taught within a family. Beyond the impact of poor job availability and opportunity, and beyond the impact of sub-par school education, though both of those are important, the attitudes that kids grow up to adopt are often those learned and observed within the family. And these attitudes can either trump or compound those other disadvantages. For example, attitudes to learning in school determine whether school is of benefit. Attitudes to work determine whether people can advance their careers.

Next, the not-so-good:
a) Those looking for answers that can shape policy may not find much to bite on. This is not really a fair criticism because the book is memoir and not a political treatise. Beyond that, JD (and his family) oscillate between thinking that the government is not doing enough to help the economic depression in Middletown (& Appalachia), and on the other hand deploring the dependence of so many of their neighbors on the dole.
Finally, some reflections on how Christian faith might speak into the above considerations.
a) JD is clearly appreciative of how strong church communities can positively impact a society, calling as he does for churches to teach kids lessons of Christian love, family & purpose. He himself was the beneficiary of that, for the short time that he was in his father’s church. His father was himself an example of the transformative power of Christ in a person’s life, having gone from being deserter of his young family to being a family man in a stable second marriage, and regular churchgoer. JD’s Mamaw too had a deep Christian faith, but despised organized religion. She taught JD that to coast through life was to squander his God-given talent, that Christian duty demanded that he take care of his family, that he needed to forgive, and that God had a plan.
b) While his father’s church had a deep impact on JD, he was subsequently to reject his faith because of aspects of evangelical theology, and doubts about the compatibility of faith and science. This speaks to how damaging it can be to the faith of young people when their church derives positions on science and faith that may be long-held but are based on poorly-grounded views of scripture. The prime example of this is the evolution/creation controversy of past centuries, but which persists today in some church cultures, especially in the USA. Somebody needs to reassure young people that they can believe in evolution and still be good Christians with a proper view of the bible. Fortunately there are signs in the book that JD has subsequently been reconsidering his rejection of the faith.
c) Even though Christian faith can result in behavioral transformation that is beneficial to the individual and to society, such transformation is merely the fruit of that faith. The origin of that faith cannot and does not lie in policy. Through the lens of faith we understand the origin of anti-social behavior to be the sin nature that we all share. Legislation has no impact on that problem. Knowing this, we may be tempted as believers to disdain efforts to help the disadvantaged and the dysfunctional among us. This would, however, not conform to the example of Jesus who was the friend of sinners and defender of the weak. It would put us more into the mold of the Pharisee who thanked God that he was not like the common riff-raff sinner. Jesus strongly condemned the superior attitude of the Pharisee. It behooves us, therefore, to be engaged with doing what we can to bring hope to the hopeless, not just of a spiritual nature but also of the physical, social, and political nature. JD testifies that he owes his rescue to a handful of loving people that rescued him. Rescue is what we should be all about, being ourselves rescued by God."
Dawn,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2025","I hadn't heard of JD Vance previous to his being selected as Vice President and wanted to know more about him. I so much enjoyed his autobiographical book, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" (as well as the Netflix film)! Vance brings us into his world of poverty and despair that is the experience of so many Americans who have been forgotten and left behind. His life experiences and ability to convey the hardships and challenges he faced (and has overcome) growing up in rural America and the rust belt are ones with which millions of readers can identify. After reading this book, I understand why he is indeed exceptionally qualified to lead and help move our country out of the endless quagmire that has caused harm to so many Americans and indeed the world. JD and his wife Usha embody the American dream of success from any background -- that lends hope for our nation and its people that we can achieve great things and not settle for narratives that lead to victimhood. Bravo!"
nicole w brown,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2018","ance uses his life story and that of his family and extended family in order to explain the cultural and economical ways of the hillbilly. Just what is a hillbilly? Generally, they are someone who is from the Appalachian Mountain region who is poor, rural, and working class. Sometimes undereducated. The stereotype has them with no teeth because they drink Moutain Dew and don't go to the dentist. Also that they are gun happy people ready to use them especially if you get their daughter pregnant. The heavy popping of opioid pills such as Percocet and Oxy began in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky, which is where the term ""pillbilly"" comes from.

Vance's Mamaw and Pawpaw came from a holler in Kentucky called Jackson. He got her pregnant at the age of thirteen and the two took the famous Route 23 out of Kentucky to Ohio (sometimes referred to as ""Middletucky"") where a good job at a steel manufacturer, Amaco, awaited. They weren't the only ones. Plenty of people from Appalachia left for jobs in Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania (or ""Pennsyltucky""), and Illinois. In the 1950s thirteen out of one hundred in Kentucky took the hillbilly highway out and in Harlan County Kentucky, thirty percent of its population, mostly coal miners, left.

Life was hard for his Mamaw and Pawpaw. She had several miscarriages and three children that survived. These included Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Wee, and his mother. His Pawpaw was an alcoholic and things could get ugly in their house. He would straighten himself out and while he and his wife stayed married they would end up with their own separate homes once their kids were grown, but remained close. But heaven help anyone who bothered one of the children or a member of the family. When Uncle Jimmy was five, he saw a toy in the pharmacy that he wanted for Christmas and his parents told him to go in and look at it while they finished shopping at a store. When he picked it up to play with it, the clerk in the store told him that he wasn't allowed to touch the toy and kicked the boy out of the pharmacy. When his parents found him and found out what happened they went in and trashed the place and stood up for their son's honor, because how dare someone tell their son that he can't come in their store.

He would take a while to adjust to a new place as his mother moved him and his older sister, Lydnsey, around to different homes with different men. The one constant was his Mamaw's place. Life with his mother was hard as she had a temper and in her relationships, fighting was the only way she knew how to deal with things. So dishes went flying and she would get violent with the men in her life.

According to J.D., this was how most hillbillies acted. Also, they spent money they didn't have at Christmas on fancy gifts for the kids, hoping the IRS refund check would cover it. Sometimes there would be someone in the house with a substance abuse problem. In J.D.'s case, it was his mother who got hooked on pills. They also abuse the Welfare system and try to get out of work if they can.

Vance basically says that you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but most of these people don't have boots. And he had helped himself. His Mamaw received a pension check from his Papaw when he died and likely social security. He credits his Mamaw, his sister, his teachers, and the Marines with helping him to avoid going down the wrong path and instead earning his degree at Ohio State and his law degree at Yale, something practically unheard of from where he was from. He offers a lot of criticism but no solutions and he overgeneralizes and forgets the people in his life that weren't loud and violent like his sister and Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Wee and cousin Gail and their spouses. It's like he wants them to be the exception that proves the rule, but there are more of them in his life than the violent argumentative types. Also, I think there are plenty of people who are dying to get jobs of any kind if you just give them a chance. And there are programs that train people in Appalachia to learn a new trade for a company that is in the area. Vance is close to using stereotypes, though with stereotypes there is some truth to them. Read this book with caution.

*Vance is contemplating a run for office and it is my opinion that he wrote this book as a stepping stone for this purpose. But that is just my opinion.

* I add this as I think it might be interesting and be a counterpoint to the book.

I was born in poverty in Appalachia. ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ doesn’t speak for me.

J.D. Vance, author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” in Washington in January. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)

By Betsy Rader September 1, 2017

Betsy Rader is an employment lawyer at Betsy Rader Law LLC, located in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. She is running as a Democrat to represent Ohio’s 14th Congressional District in the U.S. House.

J.D. Vance’s book “Hillbilly Elegy,” published last year, has been assigned to students and book clubs across the country. Pundits continue to cite it as though the author speaks for all of us who grew up in poverty. But Vance doesn’t speak for me, nor do I believe that he speaks for the vast majority of the working poor.

From a quick glance at my résumé, you might think me an older, female version of Vance. I was born in Appalachia in the 1960s and grew up in the small city of Newark, Ohio. When I was 9, my parents divorced. My mom became a single mother of four, with only a high school education and little work experience. Life was tough; the five of us lived on $6,000 a year.

Like Vance, I attended Ohio State University on scholarship, working nights and weekends. I graduated at the top of my class and, again like Vance, attended Yale Law School on a financial-need scholarship. Today, I represent people who’ve been fired illegally from their jobs. And now that I’m running for Congress in Northeast Ohio, I speak often with folks who are trying hard but not making much money.

Although high school graduation rates are rising and there are more private and federal grants available, most low-income students have a tough time attending and staying in college. Here are nine facts about poor students and the college experience. (Video: Claritza Jimenez/Photo: iStock/The Washington Post)

A self-described conservative, Vance largely concludes that his family and peers are trapped in poverty due to their own poor choices and negative attitudes. But I take great exception when he makes statements such as: “We spend our way into the poorhouse. We buy giant TVs and iPads. Our children wear nice clothes thanks to high-interest credit cards and payday loans. We purchase homes we don’t need, refinance them for more spending money, and declare bankruptcy. . . . Thrift is inimical to our being.”

Who is this “we” of whom he speaks? Vance’s statements don’t describe the family in which I grew up, and thy don’t describe the families I meet who are struggling to make it in America today. I know that my family lived on $6,000 per year because as children, we sat down with pen and paper to help find a way for us to live on that amount. My mom couldn’t even qualify for a credit card, much less live on credit. She bought our clothes at discount stores.

Thrift was not inimical to our being; it was the very essence of our being.

With lines like “We choose not to work when we should be looking for jobs,” Vance’s sweeping stereotypes are shark bait for conservative policymakers. They feed into the mythology that the undeserving poor make bad choices and are to blame for their own poverty, so taxpayer money should not be wasted on programs to help lift people out of poverty. Now these inaccurate and dangerous generalizations have been made required college reading.

Here is the simple fact: Most poor people work. Seventy-eight percent of families on Medicaid include a household member who is working. People work hard in necessary and important jobs that often don’t pay them enough to live on. For instance, child-care workers earn an average of $22,930 per year, and home health aides average $23,600. (Indeed, it is a sad irony that crucial jobs around caretaking and children have always paid very little.)

The problem with living in constant economic insecurity is not a lack of thrift, it is that people in these circumstances are always focused on the current crisis. They can’t plan for the future because they have so much to deal with in the present. And the future seems so bleak that it feels futile to sacrifice for it. What does motivate most people is the belief that the future can be better and that we have a realistic opportunity to achieve it. But sometimes that takes help.

Yes, I worked hard, but I didn’t just pull myself up by my bootstraps. And neither did Vance. The truth is that people helped us out: My public school’s guidance counselor encouraged me to go to college. The government helped us out: I received scholarships and subsidized federal loans to help pay my educational expenses. The list of helpers goes on.

Now that so many people have read “Hillbilly Elegy” this summer, I hope they draw this better moral from the story: Individuals can make a difference in others’ lives, and by providing opportunities for all, our government can do the same. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be legitimate expectations for everyone, “hillbillies” included."
Liza,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025","I just watched JD's documentary film and am now finishing his book. It is so worth the read. I especially loved his vulnerability, describing how he never believed he could go to Yale. About the importance of safe people who are ""in the know"" who can help you along the way. And how he still sometimes struggles with an angry temper which his wife Usha helps him manage. I'd love to read a book about how that works it could help so many marriages! It is rare in deed to hear a man own their own issues and in print for all to read?! Truly, that is the sign of a leader. In his book , he is is utterly transparent about his fears and saying that one can really never forget where we came from in childhood. I thought the movie was so good. I love Amy Adams and Glen Close as his mom and Memaw. So good. I hope both the book and the movie resurge now. Many of us are from dysfunctional families in fact most are to one degree or another and keeping secrets within the family make is so much more difficult as JD describes beautifully."
ironhorseranch,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025",I watched the movie first. Being a voracious reader I immediately purchased the book for my kindle. (The book is always better than the movie). The language in this book surprised me at first. I’ve never known hillbillies maybe they do cuss up a storm! I was raised poor. My father passed at age 29. My Mom had to go to work to support us. Her parents were dead. In the 1950’s there were no social services or programs to help! I never heard a curse word until high school. JD Vance’s turning around his life circumstances is nothing short of Miraculous! I throughly enjoyed this read. And the insight it gives our now Vice President of the United States is also amazing to understanding. It is comforting to know real people are in charge in the White House! By that I mean honest people we can trust!
Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","The author, the successful vice-presidential nominee in the 2024 presidential election, discusses his life story from his origins in a broken home in rural Ohio to graduating Yale Law School.

The author is a self-described hillbilly. Although neither he nor his parents were born in Appalachia, his grandparents were born and raised in Eastern Kentucky and migrated to Ohio for better opportunities. However, his grandparents maintained their connection to Appalachia. As a young person, the author would frequently travel to Kentucky and, perhaps most importantly, his family kept many of ""hillbilly"" habits. Some of these habits -- such as loyalty, especially to family -- are positive, whereas others -- such as a violent reaction to real or perceived infringements on persona honor -- are negative.

The major negative influence in the author's life was his mother. She went through a series of broken relationships and was a drug addict with mental health issues. Luckily, the author's grandparents proved a stabilizing and positive influence on his life. After he graduated high school, the author joined the Marines, then from there attended a public university (Ohio State) and an elite law school (Yale).

I feel somewhat of a connection to the author, as I also grew up in rural Appalachia, attended a non-prestigious public university for undergraduate studies and an elite law school. From a sociological perspective, there is not much to disagree with in this book. The author is correct that Appalachia -- never a prosperous or advanced region -- has in some ways fallen into even harder times, with broken homes and drug addiction plaguing the community. And the author is correct that these problems are not solely attributable to government failures or discrimination: a culture that rejects educational excellence, a tolerance for asocial behavior, a self-destructive honor code, and a loss of connection to religious institutions also condemn Appalachian people to poverty and chaos.

However, I sometimes felt that the author was ""playing it up"" for his intended audience of ""coastal elites"". At times, the author lets it slip that his family wasn't that poor -- by rural Appalachia standards, they appear to have been middle-class (although his mother's behavior was certainly reflective of the underclass). And the author, of course, wasn't born and raised in Appalachia, nor were his parents. Thus, I think the book may be more of interest to ""outsiders"" who want a glimpse into ""Trump country"", rather than for people who have lived lives closer to the author's."
Beardie mom,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025","Wow, we are lucky to have JD Vance in the White House.

His aunt lived in Hazard up a creek bed. dad's parents moved to So. IL as farmers. As I read this book, I got a clear picture of how it probably was for my ancestors! A Fuller understanding of why family gatherings were so important & family traveled long distances to get together frequently; the hard working ethics; the desire to be something more & my dad & Uncles love of new cars to show off.

Gramma Kat,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025","The absolutely best book I've read in a very long time. I couldn't put it down; I read it in two days. It generated strong emotions: I laughed, I teared up, and kept kept reading (unsolicited) excerpts to my poor husband!! Coming from a dysfunctional family, I could relate to a lot of it, but never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined what this man lived through. I have the utmost respect for him and the family members that helped him through it. Be forewarned that there's a lot of cursing and off color conversations, but I belive they're needed to honestly describe the scenarios, and only serve to make it more realistic. A raw, gut-punch of a book that really takes you into the world of the poor and forgotten. I've already recommended it to several people, and can't praise it enough. Read it, you'll walk away with a changed perspective."
HT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2017","Subtitle: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis
The November 2016 election showed me I'm out of touch with middle America. I've been reading books this winter and spring to help me get a more accurate view of the problems facing the this group. This book, along with Thomas Friedmans ""Thank You for Being Late"", and Sam Quinones' ""Dreamland"" are other pieces to the puzzle.
J.D. Vance provides a brutal and personal overview of life in America for the working and non-working poor. As he says in the first few pages, ""I want people to understand what happens in the lives of the poor and the psychological impact that spiritual and material poverty has on their children.""[p 2] Vance shows us ""a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.""[p 7] Vance was able to escape this cycle of poverty and eventually graduated from Yale law school. It's almost a miracle he made it.
Vance's grandparents moved out of Appalachian Kentucky into Ohio following work. But the work wasn't long lasting; ""As millions migrated north to factory jobs, the communities that sprouted up around those factories were vibrant but fragile: When the factories shut their doors, the people left behind were trapped in towns an cities that could no longer support such large populations with high-quality work. Those who could - generally the well educated, wealthy, or well connected - left, leaving behind communities of poor people. These remaining folks were the 'truly disadvantaged' [quoting William Julius Wilson's book of that name] - unable to find good jobs on their own and surrounded by communities that offered little in the way of connections or social support.""[p 144]
These generations of poverty create a different environment. Domestic instability. Vance never really knew his biological father; his adoptive father left, and his mother went through a string of boyfriends who had no positive effect in J.D.'s or his sister's lives. of the picture.
As kids we learn what is acceptable from our parents; in much of poor America, domestic violence is acceptable. ""Mom and Bob's problems were my first introduction to marital conflict resolution. Here were the takeaways: Never speak at a reasonable volume when screaming will do; if the fight gets a little too intense, it's okay to slap and punch, so long as the man doesn't hit first; always express your feelings in a way that's insulting and hurtful to your partner; if all else fails, take the kids and the do to a local motel, and don't tell your spouse where to find you - if he or she knows where the children are, he or she won't worry as much, and your departure won't be as effective.""[p 71] Vance's mother took the familiar path we read about in Dreamland: She starts out as an alcoholic, becomes addicted to pain killers, and eventually shoots black tar heroin. ""Psychologists call the everyday occurrences of my and Lindsay's life 'adverse childhood experiences,' or 'ACE' ''ACE's are traumatic childhood events, and their consequences reach far into adulthood. The trauma need not be physical.""[p 226]
It's obvious that the deck is stacked against the children in this situation and there is no wondering why it happens generation after generation. You learn what is ""normal"" as a child. If this is normal, then keep doing it. People lose the belief that their actions can bring about change in their lives. Luckily J.D. Vance had a small opportunity for a way out and he was able to make the most of it. He left his mother to live with his grandmother (Mamaw) who provided love, stability, and structure, which, in turn helped J.D. graduate from high school. ""Psychologists call it learned helplessness' when a person believes, as I did during my youth, that the choices I made had no effect on the outcomes in my life. From Middletown's world of small expectations to the constant chaos of our home, life had taught me that I had no control. Mamaw and Papaw had saved me from succumbing entirely to that notion, and the Marine Corp broke new ground. If I had learned helplessness at home, the Marines were teaching learned willfulness.""[p 163]
J.D. Vance's takeaways are not the usual liberal tropes; he had a part-time job as a young adult and ""every two weeks, I'd get a small paycheck and notice the line where federal and state income taxes were deducted from my wages. At least as often, our drug-addict neighbor would buy T-bone steaks, which I was too poor to buy for myself but was forced by Uncle Sam to buy for someone else. ... it was my first indication that the policies of Mamaw's party of the working man'- the Democrats - weren't all they were cracked up to be.""[p 139]
So how do we fix this problem? While Vance shows the problems with many of the current ""solutions"", he doesn't really answer that question - which I think is the biggest drawback. He sums things up by saying ""I don't know what the answer is, precisely, but I know it starts when we stop blaming Obama or Bush or faceless companies and ask ourselves what we can do to make things better.""[p 256] He's right of course. but these problems are so large, and so entrenched that we can't expect the poor to simply fix their problems themselves. Those problems are endemic; most have never learned the skills, or acquired the belief they can make a difference. And, as Thomas Friedman points out, it's only going to get worse. The pace of changes from climate change, technology, and a global market (Mother Nature, Moore's Law and the Market in Friedman's shorthand) are increasing. Where once low skill jobs could bring relatively high wages - like those jobs provided by the factories that left Middletown - those days are gone and aren't coming back.
Vance argues these problems may not be fixable; the best we can do is ""put our thumb on the scale"" to help them out. One example of putting the thumb on the scale ""would recognize what my old high school's teachers see every day; the real problem for som many of these kids is what happens (or doesn't happen) at home. For example, we'd recognize that Section 8 vouchers ough to be administered in a way that doesn't segregate the poor into little enclaves."" [p 245]
I'm willing to come down off my liberal high horse to engage the problem; but we have to develop new strategies to get that thumb on the scale.

As an aside, you can get a quick look into this problem by listening to Tom Ashbrook's On Point broadcast of June 29, 2016 entitled ""Poverty, Religion, and American Frustration"". We listened to it last summer on our road trip - which is how this book originally came to be on my bookshelf."
K.A.K.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025","I have several friends that have read Hillbilly Elegy and I decided to read it after J.D. Vance became the vice president of the United States in 2025. In this book, Mr. Vance recounts his experiences and observations of growing up poor with a tumultuous home life and how he overcame that to attend Yale Law School. It was actually one of his Yale professors, Amy Chua, who encouraged him to write a book about his journey.

I found this to be a fascinating glimpse into an American subculture that I am not a part of, but have encountered. Although it was written several years ago and before Vice President Vance began his political career, it gave me a greater appreciation for him. It will be interesting to see how his story continues to unfold."
Tami Shaikh,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2020","The memoir I chose to write about is called, Hillbilly Elegy- A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. I walked through many bookstores in search of the perfect memoir, but nothing seemed to connect with me even though I have always been a fan of memoirs. The memoirs that were best sellers, all belonged to celebrities- and I really wasn’t interested in reading those.
And then last year we all watched Brett Kavanaugh get appointed, and that just triggered something in me. I was hurt, angry and just plain simple disgusted. Being a woman who has been sexually assaulted myself, I really struggled with this decision. It was a disappointment of the worst kind – like humanity had stabbed me in the back (I know it sounds dramatic but that is how I felt). It was beyond my comprehension - how and why would people support predators, racist, misogynist homophobic douchebags. I wanted to know- really wanted to understand why? That is when a friend of mine suggested J.D. Vance’s book. She suggested that it would help me to understand how “white America” was suffering. She had supported Trump all along silently, but never had the guts to come out straight and tell me. So, I decided to read it.

When I researched the book, I realized it had been a huge success ever since it was released in 2016. Two months after its release it became a best- seller, mostly because it was marketed to people like me, who were trying to grapple with the “Trump Phenomenon.” And then I read that Mitch Mconnell asked JD Vance to run for the Ohio Senate, I really wanted to know more. My anger and desire to know more increased.

The book starts out by talking about Vance’s grandparents- Papaw and Mamaw who left Kentucky for Ohio after they got married. They try their best to raise a family while struggling simultaneously with alcoholism, abuse, family dynamics and so much more. Eventually there is a “happy ending” when JD goes to Yale Law.

After reading this book I still remain confused as to the Trump Phenomenon. I think the most interesting thing he says is on page 192, where he talks about emails and conversations he has had with friends and family. Where people believing that Obamacare legislations requires microchip implementation in new patients, Alex jones stating that 9/11 was engineered by the US government, the Newtown gun massacre was also created by the Federal government, Obama citizenship status and that Obama planned to implement martial law in order to gain third term presidency.

Is Vance’s book a good story? Yes definitely. I was in awe of his gun totting grandmother who gave him unconditional love. Even though she was hardly educated she was supportive of her grandson’s education, but what about his sister? What support did she get from the family?

Coming from Pakistan myself, my father’s side of the family still despite educating girls believe that their destiny lies in marriage. Boys are encouraged to go on to obtain a further education, however girls are groomed to get married and have children at a younger age. The same way Vance was encouraged yet his sister gets married and became a teen mom, and the author talks about how happy she is and how his brother in law is a good man and his sister was lucky to have him. It was so close to what I was told when I got married, “You’re lucky to have found such a great groom.”

Having Mamaw as the matriarch of the family, was another thing that I see commonly in Pakistan. Where many of my male cousins are raised as spoilt brats- they know exactly how to marry more than once but don’t know how to hold down a job. Usually it’s the grandmothers who take care of everyone and are revered as the head of the household. Just the way Mamaw carries the emotional burden of the family and keeps them all in line.
Another thing that I found similar between Vance’s world and people living in rural Pakistan, is their belief in patriotism. I use the world belief here, because even though they love their country, they hate anyone who isn’t like them. Pakistan being a Muslim majority country, Christians are treated with contempt and as third class citizens. I see the same divisiveness in Vance’s world, his grandparents believed America to be their “second God,” yet in the next paragraph Vance goes on to talk about how most of his community members believe Obama is a Muslim. Another paragraph down he tries to justify this racism, saying that he ‘brilliant, witty, wealthy and speaks in a perfect accent- he goes on to say:

Obama strikes at the heart of our biggest insecurities. He is a good father while many of us arent’. He wears suits to his job, while we wear overalls, if we are lucky enough to have jobs at all. His wife tells us that we shouldn’t be feeding our children certain foods, and we hate her for it- not because we think she is wrong but because we know she is right. (191)

A rhetoric I’ve often heard from religious fundamentalists in Pakistan.

He also talks about his father who did try to be present in his life with whom he lived for some time. Again, I feel like he missed out on an opportunity to discuss who is his father was. Having his father present in his life after his parents divorce is not a luxury many Americans have- this has nothing to do with race or financial stability.

Another thing that stood out:

This was my world: world of truly irrational behavior. We spend our way into the poorhouse. We buy giant TVs and IPads. Our children wear nice clothes thanks to high interest credit cards and payday loans..

“we spend our way into the poorhouse”

“we purchase homes we don’t need, refinance them for more spending money, and declare bankruptcy”

“we don’t study as children, and we don’t make our kids study when we’re parents”

“we choose not to work, when we should be looking for jobs”

“we eat Pillsbury cinnamon rolls for breakfast, Taco Bell for lunch, and McDonald’s for dinner.” (146-147)

On these pages he sounds like he is a part of a cult. The book starts out with an “I” all about Vance’s life struggles and heroism, yet when it comes to talking about the flaws and racism he feels towards others- it becomes a “we.” He sounds presumptuous and insensitive in describing the lives of people who struggle on a daily basis. Vance sounds like he is trying to take the reader along with him on how “his people” live, even though he continues to talk about now being part of the elite group of Yale Law School graduates. My question - is he convincing us or himself that he is still that young boy that was raised by his grandmother in Ohio? Or is it survivor’s guilt?

I felt like Vance was more interested in writing his journey from poverty to an elite class of Yale Law school graduates- him being the savior of his people. The typical tale of a hero, who despite life being tough has gone against all odds and made it. Another thing that he lacked was emotion and feelings that he felt during his “dark times,” his style of writing comes across as cold and distant. It definitely didn’t feel like he was writing about the “family in crisis.”

All in all, I didn’t enjoy the book much at all. I still have no clue as to why people voted for and continue to support Trump. I truly believe that if people want to spread hate- they will find any reason to do that."
Sarah,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025","This biography proves that a child who has no advantages in life, either material or emotional, can rise above it all and become successful.

I can relate to J.D. Vance's experiences because I, also, grew up in Appalachia and knew families like his. The book made it obvious that it was his tour of duty in the U.S. Army that set him on the right path but it was his personal drive to succeed that got him there.

I appreciate the honesty of how that upbringing still influences him in many ways, both good and bad."
Diane,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024","The hillbilly identity always resonated with me, even though I personally grew up on the edge of the culture. Or perhaps, I just thought our way of life was normal. JD's descriptions seem to fit my grandparents generation more than my own (I'm now 69 years old) but the drinking, infidelities, coal mining jobs, distrust of government, church attendance, and personal values of honor, family loyalty, and pride ring true to me. Each of my maternal grandparents came from families of 18 children; they had 9 children including my mum. Grandma Genny was pregnant with her last child (stillborn) at the same time my mum was pregnant with her fourth child (out of five).

Grandpap owned his own ""house mine"" for a while to earn a living. He often filled neighbors' empty coal bins without getting paid, but he did it anyway because he didn't want kids to be cold. You looked out for each other.

None of my aunts or uncles went to college. My mum, the 3rd oldest, was the first to graduate from high school - even though she got pregnant, married in April, and took her husband to the prom. Her principal had seen her marriage license in the paper and greeted her on the following Monday by telling her that he ""hoped this didn't affect her school attendance"".

I guess I AM a 3rd generation hillbilly! Fortunately, people in my life guided me; my mum's proud that I was the first grandchild to graduate from college. I'm grateful to have been a teacher for 35 years, teaching children in West Virginia and Western PA - educating my kind of people. I loved them!"
M. Rader,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2025","I bought this for my mother as a Christmas present as she is a big supporter of JD Vance, and she's also had a very similar upbringing to his. She continues to rave about this book. Every time I talk to her, she said that the language can get a little bit saucy, but she loves the stories and hearing how his upbringing was so similar to hers in the 40s. She wants me to read it when she's done and I probably will because I am a reader and I also like JD Vance.

Forget about politics for a minute, this book is not about that. It's about a man and how he was brought up very poor in Appalachia and what he and his family in did just to survive."

A very important read as we move into the next 4 years and hopefully see some changes for the better."
Samantha,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025","Hillbilly Eligy deeply moved me. Having grown up in abject poverty in the middle of an otherwise middle-class neighborhood really left a lasting impact on me. His words regarding the struggle of straddling two worlds, his conflicting feelings regarding his relationship with his mother (mine was mental illness not drugs like his mother), and his struggle managing big feelings as a result of his childhood trauma really resonated with me. As someone who broke their family cycle and built a better world for their own children, like JD Vance did, I have mad respect for the man and his sister. Most will not fathom the courage it took to write that book and acknowledge it publicly in an effort to shed light on a oft misunderstood segment of society from a real world personal perspective. Well done sir."
Monte K. Maxwell,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025",I started this book to learn more about the futureVP of our country…I finished it with a deeper understanding of who JD is and why he stands for what he stands for. I also have seen societies similar to the hillbillies in my state of Arizona and wonder how I could become part of the solution instead of a bystanders
Mimi,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025",I’m so glad I read this book. I had seen the movie when it came out and liked it. The book goes much deeper into JD’s life and way of looking at life. He is truly a success story and achieved the American Dream through a lot of struggles and hard word. A true triumph over adversity. I learned so much about the Rust Belt and the Hillbillies. He’s an amazing person and will be a great VP.
Jiminylena,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025","I don’t know what I was expecting: the author has recently been elected to the Vice-presidency of the United States. I found this book to be profoundly honest and character-revealing. A survivor’s story, honestly presented. In a culture where an attractive and successful facade are preserved at all costs, this book shows a kind of raw honesty. I found it funny and tragic in equal measure, and applaud the author."
Sherry Boyd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025","People need to hear about the truth of white-collar workers; the struggles, the heartbreak of trying to just survive, and the failures of a lot of the American culture.

Robert G. Walsh,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2025","I’m reading this after JD was elected Vice President, so my vantage point is much different than someone who read it before all the recent history has been made. I thoroughly enjoyed it and find it hopeful. If JD Vance can go from his broken and humble beginnings to become Vice President, anyone in our country can. Isn’t that the true story of the United States. God bless us."

Tom Rusk,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2025",J.D. is going to make a great vice president because of his background and military experience. My only complaint was the course language which I question really added to the story. Also I found the movie much different than the book.
Booklover,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025","Having taught over 50 years ago in hills country, coming from NYS, I found this intensely interesting. With a concentration in social sciences, it further enlightened me about the intricate part of family life in the area. However, I found my students to be endearingly naive to the outside world. Of course, the story was well-written with excellent character development and compelling from beginning to end. I would recommend teachers-in-training to be assigned the book to depict what many of their students could be experiencing in their home life to better relate to them."
Ryan Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025",This book really pulled up some emotions in me. What an incredible story. I bought it so that I could learn more about VP Vance since I didn't really know who he was. Reading this will allow you to understand him more and about what makes him operate. I could see parallels in his family and many American families I come across. Very good read and worth it regardless of what you think of his politics it is a must read.
Po-Yu,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2024","I knew about this book in 2016 when I was still a college student at Boston. I did not pay much attention to its release due to the beginning of Trump’s presidency; I guess I just assumed the memoir was some sort of a sociological testament to Trumpism, therefore I was not interested with having to read another story on mad white working-class people living in the Rust Belt.

Today, no longer a college kid, and at the same time being an elected councilor from Taiwan, I revisited this memoir because of Vance’s candidacy in 2024.

I must say, after finishing the book, I am very surprised with how much I actually enjoyed reading it.
The history of the district that I represent more or less reassemble with what Vance was describing from the Rust Belt, and how globalization has affected the societal structure of the area. I do see a lot of similarity to how working-class Taiwanese and American families are affected by these global changes.

However, I really like how Vance was honest about how his family got to the deepest point it did, and how he and his sister Lindsey got out of it, and even improved upon it despite facing such adversity socially and economically.

“God helps those who help themselves,” was what he quoted in the book, and I believe it speaks to everyone who reads it.

It does not really matter who is in charge of the government, if someone with disadvantages really want to get out from the situation they were being born into, it takes courage and resolve from the individual to fundamentally change those misfortunes from the family, or else they will just be doomed to become a repetition of excuses from old family lore."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025","Brutally honest about the destruction of white poor and middle class families by the infusion of the drug culture, poverty and poor education.

Sam,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2024","I first stumbled upon Hillbilly Elegy when I was browsing netflix for something to watch. I saw the movie- but decided not to watch. Growing up in western north carolina, I figured I did not need to watch a film recounting the culture I have grown to call home. Fast forward a year and J.D. Vance is the future vice-president-elect; now, I had to read his book. Immediately, I found myself impressed with how well-written and structured Hillbilly Elegy is. JD paints a beautiful story revolving around his tumultuous upbringing, law-school, and even some family history dating back to 1920s. The emotional connection that JD has with his grandmother was translated extremely well through the book. I found myself understanding how instrumental JD’s grandmother was in his life. I was surprised at the quality of this book and wish the Vance family all the best in their future endeavors."
knash,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025",Read this book as part of a book club. Really enjoyed how honest and raw the look at JDs life was. I'm from North Carolina and parts of this book really resonated with me and my home town. Would absolutely read again and would recommend to others.
Constantinos E. Scaros,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025","I only read this book because JD Vance has a better-than-decent chance of becoming our next president. Otherwise, I didn't think I'd be particularly interested in learning about hillbillies. I was wrong.

Vance's writing is compelling and seems very genuine. He attributes his academic success not to money or connections, but to his mom's lifelong instillment of its virtues in him. That's how it was in my neighborhood too. Many of us attained advanced degrees and we too didn't come from money or connections. We were. a neighborhood of immigrants in NYC - very different from Appalachia, but ultimately not so different after all."

Tbone,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","I bought this book after hearing about it during one of Vance's speeches. All I knew was it was a book he wrote and literally nothing more. Not knowing what it was about, it took several weeks to get around to it. But once I did, all I wanted to do was read more. I spoke about it to friends and family as it connected with me on a level few books do. No, I was not a hillbilly or from anywhere near Kentucky. But the characteristics of a messed up family life and how he reacted really hit home. The cultural similarities were absolutely shocking, considering I grew up totally middle class in CA. Keeping up the family image, not airing dirty laundry, ungodly fights, I simply did not expect any of the family life of a Kentucky hillbilly to resonate with a family from CA. Clinging to relatives for survival. The endless list of people who dramatically influenced his life for the positive. How he captured his feelings when he gets into an argument, even as an adult, unreal to me. Additionally, it was eye-opening to read his views on the situation from which he came - very poor, few figures to emulate, highly charged environment. And the issues these people face. You see things in a way that is much, much larger than simply, ""that family is poor. They must have made poor life choices."" The questions implied as to how can things be improved for these people, what role does or should government play, where is government intervention useless, what is the role of the society and culture in the development of the individuals. The book made me think about old issues in a very new light. I cannot wait to see the movie."
Cody Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021","Everybody has adversity to overcome in life. We are all dealt a different hand of cards and must do our best to beat the house. In Hillbilly Elegy, J.D. Vance tells of his own hardships growing up in rural Middletown Ohio, a city that has seen a steady decline in its social fabric (due in no small part to the evacuation of the steel industry). With a drug addicted mother and an absent father, he is still one of the lucky ones because he had a grandmother, or Mamaw, who watched out for him and encouraged him to do well in school. Sometimes all it takes is one adult figure to offer support and love to a child in order for them to ‘make it.’

In his book, Vance writes how he “watched some friends blossom into successful adults and others fall victim to the worst of Middletown’s temptations—premature parenthood, drugs, incarceration.” He continues: “What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are the expectations that they have for their own lives.” When I look back at my own childhood, this rings with an element of truth. In my family, for example, going to college was the expectation. There was never a conversation about whether or not I wanted to go, or whether or not it made sense for me to attend a university depending on what I wanted to do with my life as an adult. It was simply what kids like me did after high school. Only as an adult did I become aware of the other options to kids coming out of high school: working a job, traveling, joining the armed services or the peace corps, etc. But the expectation for me, set by my parents and by extension my middle class background, was that I go to college. While reading Hillbilly Elegy, I found myself wondering what it would feel like to not have that expectation, or any expectation of getting anything out of life at all. A truly existential crisis, and yet one that a huge population of the people in this country face!

Almost every aspect of Vance’s life was setting him up for failure. Whether it was the acceptance of gun violence as a means to settle arguments or his mother putting soda in his baby bottle, his life was designed to keep him incapable of growth in all the important ways. Yet somehow, he made it out and now lives a comfortable happy life in Cincinnati. While regulatory bodies have done their best to help, and some of their policies have indeed made it easier for poor people to afford food and medicine, the revelation that Vance offers inside these pages is that poverty is culturally systemic. The hardships of Hillbilly culture, abundant in Appalachia and the midwest, will be a losing battle for those of us on the outside wanting to help. Herein lies the million dollar question: how do we help a culture that views outsiders with suspicion and aggression? Not to mention a cultural pride that would never admit to having a problem in the first place, and would tell you to shove off if you asked.

The answer, it seems, is people like Vance. If he was able to grow up and ultimately thrive (he graduated from Yale Law School) then he is living proof that the American Dream is possible for the poor communities of the rust belt. Being an insider, perhaps he is the key, the antidote to a system inherently untrusting of outsiders. Sometimes all a child needs is a role model to aspire to, whether it be a politician, a musician, a scientist, or someone else of merit. Perhaps Vance can offer hope to some of the midwest’s most destitute children and communities.

This book ultimately helped me realize the vast differences in culture across the United States. While I was aware of worldwide cultural differences, I think it a truth that many of us forget the vast variety of people and different ways of life that exist within the 3 billion square miles of land that make up the continental United States. Hillbilly Elegy inspired empathy in me for people who grow up embroiled in trauma and I sincerely hope that Vance can find progressive ways to help uplift his broken community."
einsteinboricua,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2019","TL;DR version: recommended for understanding Appalachian Americans.

Long story: I grew up away from the states (Puerto Rico to be precise). My perception of the country has been that, with the exception of the Solid South (think Confederacy here), most of the states were on relative equal footing. Enter adulthood and my deeper understanding of the various regions in the country: the South, the Northeast, the Midwest, the Rust Belt, the ""Left"" Coast, the Mountainous West, the Plains, Appalachia...I still felt there was something more to all of them than just regional identities. There were two things I wanted to understand.

1. After the 2016 election when Trump was elected, I was baffled by some states and their overwhelming support of Trump. A state like Kansas was expected to go red. A state like Ohio usually never strays too far from the average, yet it went redder than normal. PA and MI were slightly tilted to the GOP. But the state that I found extremely surprising was West Virginia. The state had trending red at the federal level since the 2000 election when it gave Bush its electoral votes over Al Gore (the first time the state narrowly voted for the GOP, save for the waves of Reagan and Nixon) and it was clear that after Obama had won in 2008 and 2012, West Virginians had no more love for Democrats. Appalachia had been a reliable Democratic stronghold but little by little it eroded until in 2016 there were barely any pockets that supported Clinton. During the 2016 primaries, West Virginia Democrats overwhelmingly chose Bernie Sanders over Clinton. While Clinton may have doomed herself by saying she would kill coal, her proposal was not as radical as Sanders who also proposed an end to coal but had no plan for those affected by it. Kentucky was narrowly carried by Clinton, but the Appalachia region went for Sanders. How was it possible that these regions would support someone who would be more hawkish against coal than Clinton? And why do they cling to an industry that, contrary to what conservatives say, is dying because it's not economically feasible anymore?

2. As Southern states began trending Republican, it was understandable that the GOP adopted a policy of ""free market"" (i.e. reduce the role of government in many aspects) which many Southern conservatives still care about. West Virginia, however, bucked that trend until 2014, becoming the last state in the South to convert to the GOP. But I wonder if the change was more as a backlash against Democrats or because they truly believed in the GOP's policies. How was it possible that, while coal mines and factories shut down and folks become unemployed, the region continues to elect politicians that chip away at the social safety nets that can help these folks get back on their feet?

Enter a West Virginian coworker with whom I discussed these things. He said that to understand all of that, I needed to understand the culture of the area and he recommended this book. He had read for himself and he confirmed that, while his life wasn't as chaotic as the author's, he knew of many people who were like that and had seen his surroundings as matching those of the author. Granted, the author talks about Ohio and Kentucky (the two states where he lived most of his young life), but the region overall is Appalachia.

This book is definitely a must read. It brought a sense of understanding of the many struggles of the region and it made clear that the American system is not applied equally across the country. Even the poorest areas in the richer states are better off that many regions of Appalachia.

The author talks about the origins of his family (his maternal family as his biological dad is an absent figure) and the entire matriarchy down to his level. He talks about the psychological struggles of having a mother who verbally abuses him and even threatens to kill him, how his grandparents were his stabilizing figures, and how eventually he overcame all of it to become an accomplished lawyer and overall person. He also touches on personal responsibility. He admits to having made mistakes of his own and not blame them on anyone or anything (also noting how many in the region do not do it).

They say that before you judge a man, you must walk a mile in their shoes. Well, this book gives you that and so much more. For the record, though I identify as liberal in the political spectrum, I feel it is important to gain a better understanding of opposing views. Perhaps understanding the region overall can help us (and hopefully current and aspiring national politicians) identify the flaws in our system and ensure that the it works to the benefit of all and not just the successful ones.

In other words: if you're a liberal this is a very interesting read if you want to understand why some people think our ideas are stupid. And it highlights the importance of why some regions are the way they are."

cheryl provence,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025",The best education on Hillbilly life you will ever receive. This book is beautifully written by someone who truly knows: J.D. Vance.
Ryan B,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2017","This book hit me like a ton of bricks. I was moved to tears more than once. There are parallels all over the place to the life of my parents, their parents, and to me. Also offered are insights into why there was shouting in my childhood home. Why there is (a decreasing amount of) shouting in my adulthood home. Why I am always ready for conflict. I've spent over 10 years now trying to understand myself better as I walk the path of constant improvement. I learned more in this book than in most of that time because the material is so relevant to my experience. Maybe I'm also ready to hear it. In some ways the story is a validation that nothing is wrong with me. JD's insights helped me understand why I am who I am. They also helped me understand that I'm still perpetuating some of the cycle. But I think we've broken it.

My father never met his biological father. He had 4 stepfathers though, and 10+ siblings with 4 different last names. I have an uncle Bubba. Yes, Bubba on the birth certificate. They traveled all over for various reasons and ended up in Baltimore. My father endured tremendous abuse but ""escaped"", in that he has a life long marriage and a job that (barely) got him to retirement without losing the progress he made. The Steel Mill in Baltimore shut down just 5 years ago. He has a modest home, a dog, poor health, little retirement, a successful son and a daughter who still lives at home, but has no real extended family connections. Still worlds beyond anyone else in his family.

My mother was a Mullins, and prior to her parents' marriage they were both already Mullins. They came from Appalachia. In fact my Great Uncle Denny wrote a series of books called Tales of Appalachia. For some reason my Granddaddy Mullins and his brothers seemed to largely make it out ok. Kind people with a gentle way and good families that pursued higher education. But my Mami Mullins was a different story. Mean, nasty to her kids, and a drunk. She was as sweet as pie to me but her impact on my mother ended up affecting me anyway. Granddaddy and Mami moved from Virginia to Baltimore for Mill Work like so many others. The Mullins descend from the Mayflower. American Originals.

Being 1 to 2 generations removed from Appalachia I can tell you the family culture follows. I lived in a home with lots of shouting and a fair amount of racism, sexism, poor decisions and abuse. But my parents stayed together. I have no idea how I made it out.

But like JD I don't fit into either world now. I'm not at home at the swim club, the golf course, with the dads sidelined at a birthday party, or the poker game where everyone flaunts their Alma matter gear as a badge of honor. Often the first questions asked include ""where did you go to school"", ""what is your handicap"", or perhaps casual conversation about vacations abroad. I have never left North America. Always a brutal reminder of your rung in society. It's not just money. As the years have passed and with the help of several mentors I have learned the manners and ways of the mid/upper class. Suffering judgement and horrible embarrassment along the way. My wife has taught me things that many children under 10 know (including mine now). Like waiting for others to get their food before eating, not eating the last of anything (ever), that iced tea shouldn't have 2 cups of sugar, or that your belt should match your shoes. God Bless her.

Conversely, I'm alienated by family that assumes I think I'm too good for them because of my slightly evolved behavior, habits, and parenting style. It's their insecurity but corrosive nonetheless. I'm shunned from events and cousins I spent years riding bikes and causing trouble with don't know how to talk to me. I can't associate with old friends with 1 or 2 exceptions.

But the guys in the new neighborhood can tell that I don't quite belong. So I'm partially accepted. I have succeeded in a white collar world with a tenacious drive and a God given brain. But I am not traditionally educated. I have a 20 year old son who was born when I was 17. He is a Junior at a private college. I have 4 younger children who will be educated and are being brought up with some of that hillbilly parenting style, though markedly less than generations before. And we try every day to continue breaking the cycle.

I think we did it. JD did it in one generation. It's taken us a series of steps."

Jason G,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024","When J.D. Vance got nominated to run for Vice President, I thought I would give this book a read. I had already seen the made of TV movie so I though I knew what to expect. Boy, was I wrong. The movie simply scratched the surface while the book went deep into the good, the bad and the ugly of growing up and living in general in the ""hillbilly"" culture. At times it is pretty humorous, at others, it is heartbreaking. And one very interesting thing for me was that it felt like no matter whether you could identify with the particular difficulties and nuances of the life Vance grew up knowing, there seemed to be something there we could all relate to in some way."
William K.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","I saw the movie before reading the book, and the movie makes a few changes. But the basic storyline remains the same. The author gives a description of his family and how his grandparents moved to Middletown, OH to find employment in the steel mill there. They made a mostly middle-class life there, but as time went on, family troubles reared their ugly head beginning before the author's birth. He found himself in an unstable family situation with an abusive mother and her revolving door of relationships, partners, boyfriends, and the occasional ex-husband. His grandmother took an interest and he was able to turn his life around and discover a way out of that place and life. He states that just living his life has taught him things that the average person in Middletown would have no way of knowing. He was able to achieve an amazing amount of upward mobility by making some smart choices and being willing to set goals and work for them.

His concern is that he sees the people from his hometown and many others like them slipping into an abyss of poverty, addiction, and abuse. Some of this is self-inflicted, and that the people seem to have lost their drive, ambition, and upward mobility. He fears that we stand to lose a large segment of society because of these problems, and states that society cannot afford to let its working-class people sink into quicksand. It goes contrary to the American Dream, but he said it's telling that several European countries are doing the American Dream better than we do here because their working classes have experienced far more upward mobility than ours has.

He does not claim to have a sweeping solution nor all the answers to every question or concern. But he is right to be concerned. Call the book the canary in the coal mine who might be chirping just before it's too late. Also, it's a terrible shame that this book will be given some kind of knee-jerk discrediting because the author espouses politically conservative viewpoints. This is not a conservative book. This is a memoir that takes a hard look at society and is concerned by what is revealed."
Jesse Brown,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","No wonder “Hillbilly Elegy” by J.D. Vance is #1 on Amazon’s top purchased books in July 2024, a New York Times Best Seller, and a Netflix movie!!!!!!

(This review does not contain vital spoilers.)

J.D. should be commended for his poignant work, not solely for its exceptional literary quality but for the emotional and informative depth that resonates throughout the narrative. His ability to evoke genuine sentiment is a testament to his storytelling prowess, shocking experiences, and time as a life-long learner. While reading, I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading non-fiction.

His mother was constantly changing up what the “D” in “J.D.” stood for. For me, a humorous moment in the book is when J.D. remarks on his aversion to the name ""Donald."" When writing this, he had no way of knowing who his future running mate for the United States Presidential Candidacy would be 8 years after this masterpiece was published. That made me laugh out loud.

J.D.'s candid portrayal of his family's struggles offers a stark portrayal of small-town America, urging readers to look beyond initial impressions. I can’t put into words the courage it must have taken him to share the darkest moments and terrible choices of his mother (and other family members) for the world to read about. His courage in revealing personal hardships and familial dynamics underscores the book's authenticity and societal relevance.

J.D.'s exploration of the cyclical nature of poverty, addiction, and fractured families underscores a broader message of resilience and the capacity for change. By drawing parallels between different communities facing systemic challenges, he prompts reflection on shared human experiences and the potential for societal transformation. J.D. proves that we are not facing a race war, but a socioeconomic one right here within our own borders.

J.D. wrote: “Mamaw and Papaw taught me that we live in the best and greatest country on earth. This fact gave meaning to my childhood. Whenever times were tough- when I felt overwhelmed by the drama and the tumult of my youth- I knew that better days were ahead because I lived in a country that allowed me to make the good choices that others hadn’t. (Chapter 11)” That is the sum of this book.

I wholeheartedly recommend “Hillbilly Elegy” to EVERYONE regardless of political affiliations. It serves as a poignant commentary on humanity, the pursuit of the American Dream, and the resilience inherent in the face of adversity. J.D.'s narrative has the power to inspire and provoke thought, leaving a lasting impact on readers. This is an elegy that will stick with me for so many good reasons.

J.D., if you happen to read this review- Thank you for your service in the Marine Corps. Thank you for sharing this highly personal story. Thank you for standing for what is right. And thank you for agreeing to be our next Vice President. Congratulations to your mom on 10 years of sobriety. I’m praying for your family, you, and our country."

Thomas M. Loarie,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2016","Author J.D. Vance in his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” provides a first-hand account of growing up and then escaping a small town in Appalachia where the manufacturing jobs have been disappearing, wages have been stagnant, and opiate addiction has become rampant. The book speaks to the anger and frustration of the “forgotten” white working class not only in Appalachia but to other areas of the country which have suffered the same fate. These are the people who were without a voice and found one in Donald Trump. These are the people who changed the trajectory of American politics in 2016.

But most importantly, this book speaks to love, to the importance of family and to adult mentors who are committed to human potential. Vance’s escape from generational hopelessness had nothing to do with public programs and social services, most of which made things worse.

(Vance’s experience echoes the work of Mitch Pearlstein’s excellent book, “From Family Collapse to America’s Decline,” which goes beyond rural America and encompasses the plight of all low and middle income Americans who are being squeezed by job loss and stagnant wages.)

Vance did not grow up with parents who modeled love, how to seek the truth, how to be considerate and forgiving, how to work together, and how to grow in virtue. His family environment was unstable and did not provide an opportunity for him to become what God was calling him to be.

His early family life in Kentucky then in southeastern Ohio was tough. His mother got pregnant at 18, was divorced by 19 and remarried four times. She became a heroin addict after becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. At one time, she threatened to kill them both by crashing her car. His biological father was an absentee dad.

His escape had everything to do with the love of his grandparents, their faith in God and their commitment to a better future for Vance. He moved in with them in high school. They were the ones who inspired Vance to do more with his life. By always being there for him, they provided love and some semblance of stability by always being there for him.

The Marines then filled in by teaching personal discipline and how he could negotiate the simple things of adult life… like how to get a low interest loan. Later teachers at Yale pushed Vance to educational excellence.

Vance wrote the book to answer questions about his own upbringing and how he arrived at an Ivy League school and today, at an investment firm in San Francisco. The book’s publication in 2016 was timely as it intersected with Donald Trump’s presidential run and his “Make America Great” campaign which zeroed in on the plight of the white working-class. Vance’s experience has since become a part of the national conversation about social divisions in the United States and feelings of disenfranchisement among the white working class.

According to Vance, the secret sauce for those disenfranchised is not found in public initiatives. No amount of government handouts and safety nets will ever match what love can do - Love within an intact family, love of teaching others to reach their potential and, most importantly, the love of God as shown to us by others and their good works.

Vance believes the following needs to be done to help others escape “hopelessness”:
o Religious leaders need to build communities that engage people to help one another.
o Parents need to recognize how destructive chaos – fighting, screaming, addiction, divorce - is to their children’s future.
o School leaders need to be more cognizant of what’s going on in student’s home life. A student living in chaos will focuse on survival not grades.
o Most of all, people must hold themselves (and be held) responsible for their own conduct and choices. “Those of us who were not given every advantage can make better choices and those choices do have the power to affect our lives.”

The greatest contributor to the common good is the family, in which children are brought into the world by the faithful and lasting love of a man and woman. It is the first and indispensable school of love, and when a majority of its citizens are deprived of it, society itself becomes chaotic and angry. In a loving and stable home, built on faith and virtue, parents model for their children out of love, how to seek the truth, how to be considerate and forgiving, how to work together, how to grow in virtue and the right use of freedom and how to be generous to those in need. In such homes, young people have the greatest opportunity to become those men and women God is calling them to be.

Indeed, the family is the glue that holds our culture and our society together. Vance was fortunate that he had the “family” provided by his grandparents. They were the glue."

Dave Schwinghammer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","The protagonist of HILLBILLY ELEGY does not sound like the V.P. candidate who refers to liberal females as “cat ladies”. Young J.D. Vance sounds like an admirable person who pulled himself up by his bootstraps.

J.D.’s mother was an addict. At first it sounded like she was hooked on opioid pills but later on there was a reference to heroin. Anyway, J.D. spent the last three years of high school living with Mamaw, his grandmother.

J.D. has a lot to say about the hillbillies who moved from Jackson, Kentucky to Middletown, Ohio. They brought their culture with them. For instance one transplanted hillbilly got in trouble with the town government over keeping chickens in his back yard. J.D. goes on to say “...hillbillies shared many regional characteristics with the southern blacks arriving in Detroit.” J.D. had to deal with abuse, alcoholism, and poverty. The sound of family life he was familiar with was a lot of yelling and screaming.

J.D. didn’t hear that at his Mamaw’s house. She encouraged him to succeed, and he did, joining the marines. He says the marines taught him how to be a man; at one point he was about to pay 22% interest on a loan to buy a car, but his fellow marines talked him out of that, and he got the loan for half that. From there he went to Ohio State on the G.I. bill, graduating in two years, after which he was accepted at Yale Law School, but he still felt like a hillbilly amongst his mostly rich classmates.

Considering where he came from and the mountains he had to climb, it’s hard to believe this guy is running for V.P. alongside Donald J. Trump, his direct opposite."

Michael Cicale,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2025",This book has made me look and examine my own life. Though I may not have reached the pinnacle of JD Vance; I am satisfied as to how far I have come in my life but the book also makes me realize I could have done more if I had the capacity to understand how much family drama would have played in my decision making. Thank You JD.

Bridgette Holley,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","My interest in the now Vice President-Elect, J.D. Vance was piqued by comments he made at the 2024 Republican National Convention regarding his Mamaw and her 19 guns.

I instantly connected with his description of her. For the record, my grandma’s self-defense weapon of choice was the machete.

I sought to find out, how much in common does a black woman raised in rural Eastern North Carolina have in common with a hillbilly with roots in Appalachia?

It turns out, a lot. For starters, we are both 40 and our grandmothers played pivotal roles in our lives. In the book, when he spoke of the expectation of having “a good Christmas” as a child, and his culture shocks in the Marine Corps and college, his experiences mirrored my own.

A few of many quotes that resonated with me:

“I’ve seen far too many people awash in genuine desire to change only to lose their mettle when they realize just how difficult change actually is.”

“I learned that the very traits that enabled my survival during childhood inhibit my success as an adult.”

“Social capital is all around us. Those who tap into it and use it prosper.”

For many, whose adult life is so drastically different from their childhood, reading Hillbilly Elegy is like going home…and saying goodbye."

Sharon G.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2025","Normally I don’t read non-fiction, but this book was very interesting. Every American adult should read this book. Most Americans have no concept of this culture and their way of living. He shares his trials and triumphs, and his ideas of how to help these children. What he went through and what he achieved is amazing. It is truly a remarkable book about an incredible life. I highly recommend this book."

Wendy Oconnell,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2018","I read The Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance because it is on my daughter’s reading list this summer and reading what she reads allows me to connect with her through our life long love of books. The Hillbilly Elegy is the best book I’ve read in a long time. The last book I read on my daughter’s list was Ayn Rand’s Anthem, and the classical rhetorical laced with her “I” agenda made me graze pages like a fat cow eager for slaughter. Kill me, please! No offense to Rand, she has her merits, but I wanted a story. I am a big tootsie pop (sucker) for good stories. Now several key ingredients make up a well-constructed story beginning with a Shakespearean understanding of the human condition.
1. Vance understands the human condition. The human condition are the characteristics, essential events, and particular events which evolve around birth, growth, and inner and outer conflict.
“Mamaw could spew venom like a Marine Corps drill instructor, but what she saw in our community didn’t just piss her off. It broke her heart.”
Vance understands what motivates the anger behind his Mamaw’s words, and it cuts at the core of the human condition. Vance’s book is loaded with this understanding, not just Mamaw, but his father and the reason he gave him up in the first place, his mother and her continuous struggle with drugs and men, his Aunt Wee, and his sister Lindsay, and finally his own human condition revealed in the monster dream at the end.
2. Themes of forgiveness bathed in hope and the strength to overcome adversity. Vance came from dirt poor and turned Ivy League Yale graduate now living the American dream. He didn’t make that journey with the human feelings of anger and resentment that often blames others for their circumstances; He made it with love, forgiveness and understanding.
“For me understanding my past and knowing I wasn’t doomed gave me the hope and fortitude to deal with the demons of my youth.”

3. Humility: Vance credits his success hugely to his mamaw and papaw. “Few of even my closest friends understood how utterly hopeless my life would have been without Mamaw and Papaw. So maybe I just wanted to give credit where credit is due.”

He doesn’t only credit Mamaw and Papaw, but a whole slew of blue-collar workers who helped him to achieve his Ivy League dream. These people include his sister, his cousin Gail, his Aunt Wee and even his mother, despite her many problems, instilled in him a lifelong love of education.
Vance says, “Remove any of these people from the equation and I’m probably screwed.”

4. Accessibility: The Hemingway/Shrunk in White style of writing has a conversational syntax that can be grasped by anyone. Vance may be Ivy League now, but he still has the heart of his hillbilly ancestors and he knows how to speak to them and for them.

5. Humor: This book will make you laugh out loud despite some of the horrific circumstances in Vance’s childhood, the laughter was the hope as conveyed in many of Mamaw’s speeches, especially this particular one on bullying.

“And she said something I will never forget: ‘Sometimes, honey, you have to fight, even when you’re not defending yourself. Sometimes it’s just the right thing to do.’ Then she taught me a move, a swift hard (make sure to turn your hips) punch right to the gut.”

6. Solutions: Glass Castle by Jeanette Walls is similar to Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy because it shows a tough upbringing turned successful; however, as good as that story was, Walls did not offer any solutions for the homeless. Now, I’m not saying Vance offers great solutions for the problems with poverty in our country, but he does offer simple solutions, ones involving self-examination and our role in society. Recently, someone told me to read Black Rednecks and White Liberals by Thomas Sowell (the title made me hesitate reminding me of a book Tom Buchanan liked in The Great Gatsby), now while this book probably offers great solutions; It was not what I looked for with Vance’s book. In Vance’s book I looked for a story about a poor boy who went Ivy. Vance’s book is a memoir and the parallel to Sowell’s non-fiction book just doesn’t work here. I recommend Vance’s book to all of those people who still believe in the American Dream and the hope and love where good family support fuels the dream. Vance’s tone is so optimistic for those wanting to follow a similar path, and even more so to everyone who wants stability, a home, a family and love."
